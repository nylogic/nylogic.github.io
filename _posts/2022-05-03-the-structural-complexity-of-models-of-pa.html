The Scott rank of a countable structure is the least ordinal $&#92;alpha$ such that all
automorphism orbits of the structure are definable by infinitary
$&#92;Sigma_{&#92;alpha}$ formulas. Montalbán showed that the Scott rank of
a structure is a robust measure of the structural and computational complexity
of a structure by showing that
various different measures are equivalent. For example, a structure has
Scott rank $&#92;alpha$ if and only if it has a $&#92;Pi_{&#92;alpha+1}$ Scott sentence if
and only if it is uniformly $&#92;pmb &#92;Delta_&#92;alpha^0$ categorical if and only if
all its automorphism orbits are $&#92;Sigma_&#92;alpha$ infinitary definable.

In this talk we present results on the Scott rank of non-standard models of Peano arithmetic. We show that 
non-standard models of PA have Scott rank at least $&#92;omega$, but, other
than that, there are no limits to their complexity. Given a completion $T$ of
$PA$ we give a reduction via bi-interpretability of the class of linear orders
to the models of $T$. This allows us to exhibit models of $T$ of Scott rank
$&#92;alpha$ for every $&#92;omega&#92;leq &#92;alpha&#92;leq &#92;omega_1$. In particular, every
completion of $T$ has models of high Scott rank.
