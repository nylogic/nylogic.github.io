<p>
Borel chromatic numbers of definable graphs on Polish spaces have been studied for 25 years, starting with the seminal paper by Kechris, Solecky and Todorcevic.  I will talk about some recent results about the consistent separation of uncountable Borel chromatic numbers of some particular graphs and about the Borel chromatic number of graphs related to Turing reducibility.
