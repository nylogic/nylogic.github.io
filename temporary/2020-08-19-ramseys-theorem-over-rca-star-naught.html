The usual base theory used in reverse mathematics, $&#92;mathrm{RCA}_0$, is the fragment of second-order arithmetic axiomatized by $&#92;Delta^0_1$ comprehension and $&#92;Sigma^0_1$ induction. The weaker base theory $&#92;mathrm{RCA}^*_0$ is obtained by replacing $&#92;Sigma^0_1$ induction with $&#92;Delta^0_1$ induction (and adding the well-known axiom $&#92;exp$ in order to ensure totality of the exponential function). In first-order terms, $&#92;mathrm{RCA}_0$ is conservative over $&#92;mathrm{I}&#92;Sigma_1$ and $&#92;mathrm{RCA}^*_0$ is conservative over $&#92;mathrm{B}&#92;Sigma_1 + &#92;exp$. </p><p>
Some of the most interesting open problems in reverse mathematics concern the first-order strength of statements from Ramsey Theory, in particular Ramsey's Theorem for pairs and two colours. In this talk, I will discuss joint work with Kasia Kowalik, Tin Lok Wong, and Keita Yokoyama concerning the strength of Ramsey's Theorem over $&#92;mathrm{RCA}^*_0$.</p>
Given standard natural numbers $n,k &#92;ge 2$, let $&#92;mathrm{RT}^n_k$ stand for Ramsey's Theorem for $k$-colourings of $n$-tuples. We first show that assuming the failure of $&#92;Sigma^0_1$ induction, $&#92;mathrm{RT}^n_k$ is equivalent to its own relativization to an arbitrary $&#92;Sigma^0_1$-definable cut. Using this, we give a complete axiomatization of the first-order consequences of $&#92;mathrm{RCA}^*_0 + &#92;mathrm{RT}^n_k$ for $n &#92;ge 3$ (this turns out to be a rather peculiar fragment of PA) and obtain some nontrivial information about the first-order consequences of $&#92;mathrm{RT}^2_k$. Time permitting, we will also discuss the question whether our results have any relevance for the well-known open problem of characterizing the first-order consequences of $&#92;mathrm{RT}^2_2$ over the traditional base theory $&#92;mathrm{RCA}_0$.
