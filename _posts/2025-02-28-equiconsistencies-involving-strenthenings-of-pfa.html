<p>
We discuss the famous open problem of determining the exact consistency strength of PFA. We present an equiconsistency between Ben Goodman's Sigma_n-Correct Proper Forcing Axiom, which implies PFA, and supercompact for C^(n-1)-cardinals under additional mild assumptions for large enough n. Without these assumptions we can prove a dichotomy resembling Woodin's HOD dichotomy with a model containing the mantle taking on the role of HOD.
