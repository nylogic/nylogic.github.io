abstract: "<p>
We consider three variations of the L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem Theorem type statements 
on stationary logics. These statements imply respectively that the size of the continuum is
$&#92;aleph_1$, $&#92;aleph_2$ or very big (e.g. hyper, hyper, ... weakly Mahlo).</p>

<p>We also consider reflection principles in terms of games and strengthenings 
of generic supercompactness which are related to these three L&ouml;wenheim-Skolem Theorems 
for stationary logics.
