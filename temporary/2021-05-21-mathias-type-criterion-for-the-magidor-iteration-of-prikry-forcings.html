abstract: "

<p>In his seminal work on the identity crisis of strongly compact cardinals, Magidor introduced a special iteration of Prikry forcings for a set of measurable cardinals known as the Magidor iteration.  The purpose of this talk is to present a Mathias-type criterion which characterizes when a sequence of omega-sequences is generic for the Magidor iteration.
The result extends a theorem of Fuchs, who introduced a Mathias criterion for discrete products of Prikry forcings. We will
present the new criterion, discuss several applications, and outline the main ideas of the proof.
