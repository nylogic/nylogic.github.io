It is well known that if an inaccessible cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is singularized to countable cofinality while preserving cardinals, then $&#92;square_{&#92;kappa_&#92;omega}$ holds in the outer model. Moreover, this remains true even when relaxing the cardinal preservation assumption a bit. In this talk we focus on when Prikry forcing adds weaker forms of square in a more general setting. We prove abstract theorems about when Prikry forcing with interleaved collapses to bring down the singularized cardinal to $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$ will add a weak square sequence. This can be viewed as a partial positive result to a question of Woodin about whether the failure of SCH at $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$ implies weak square.
