In the talk we address the following problem: how many essentially different truth definitions (for the language of arithmetic) are there? Formally, a truth definition for us is just a sentence $&#92;phi$ in some language $L$, which extends the elementary arithmetic (a.k.a. $I&#92;Delta_0 + &#92;exp$) and such that for some $L$-formula $&#92;Theta(x)$, $$&#92;phi&#92;vdash &#92;psi&#92;equiv&#92;Theta(&#92;ulcorner&#92;psi&#92;urcorner),$$ for every sentence $&#92;psi$ in the language of arithmetic. In other words $&#92;phi$ is a sentence which can define a truth predicate for arithmetic (via a formula $&#92;Theta(x)$). We investigate the structure of the definability relation between so defined truth definitions. To be more precise: we say that a truth definition $&#92;phi$ (in a language $L$) defines a truth definition $&#92;phi'$ (in a language $L'$) if and only if there are $L$-formulae $A_1,&#92;ldots,A_n$ such that $&#92;phi&#92;vdash &#92;phi'[A_1/R_1,&#92;ldots,A_n/R_n]$, where $R_i$'s are all the non-arithmetical predicates from the language $L'$ and $&#92;phi'[A_1/R_1,&#92;ldots,A_n/R_n]$ denotes the result of translating $&#92;phi'$ by substituting $A_i$ for each occurrence of $R_i$. We note that this translation does not relativize the quantifiers in $&#92;phi'$ and keeps the arithmetical symbols unchanged. Our main result is that the structure consisting of truth definitions which are conservative over the basic arithmetical theory forms a countable universal distributive lattice. Additionally, we (slightly) generalize the result of Pakhomov and Visser showing that the set of (Gödel codes of) definitions of truth is not $&#92;Sigma_2$-definable in the standard model of arithmetic.</p><p>This is joint work with Piotr Gruza which was published <a href='https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00153-024-00909-6'>in here</a>.</p>
