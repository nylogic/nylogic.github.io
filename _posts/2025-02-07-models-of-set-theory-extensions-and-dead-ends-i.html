This is a two-part talk concerning existence/non-existence
of certain kinds of extensions of arbitrary models of ZF, with no
regard to countability or well-foundedness of the models involved. The
talk is based a recent preprint: <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14790v1'>arXiv:2406.14790v1</a>. The results
presented include the following two. In Theorem A below, N is said to
be a conservative elementary extension of M if N is an elementary
extension of M with the property that the intersection of every
parametrically definable subset of N with M is parametrically
definable in M.<br>
<strong>Theorem A</strong>. Every model M of ZF with a definable global well-ordering
has a conservative elementary extension N that contains an ordinal
above all of the ordinals of M.<br>
<strong>Theorem B</strong>. Every consistent extension of ZF has a model of power
aleph_1 that has no end extension to a model of ZF.
