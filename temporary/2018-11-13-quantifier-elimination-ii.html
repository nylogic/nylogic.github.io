abstract: "<p>
In this talk, I will give some key definitions related to automorphisms of countable models of Presburger arithmetic, and summarize some results (such as quantifier elimination and DP rank) for an expansion by a specific modest automorphism.  At my second talk, I will prove, or sketch proofs of, those results.
