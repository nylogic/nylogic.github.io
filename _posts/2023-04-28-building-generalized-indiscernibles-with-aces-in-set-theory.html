<p>
Generalized indiscernibles can be built in first-order theories by generalizing the combinatorial Ramseyâ€™s Theorem to classes with more structure, which is an active area of study.  Trying to do the same for infinitely theories (in the guise of Abstract Elementary Classes) requires generalizing the Erdos-Rado Theorem instead.  We discuss various results about generalizations of the Erdos-Rado Theorem and techniques (including large cardinals and forcing) to build generalized indiscernible.
