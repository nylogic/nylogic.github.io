abstract: "<p>
A virtual large cardinal is (usually) the critical point of a generic elementary embedding from a rank-initial segment of the universe into a transitive $M&#92;subset V$, as introduced by Gitman and Schindler (2018). A notable feature is that all virtual large cardinals are consistent with $V=L$, and they've proven useful in characterising several properties in descriptive set theory. We'll work with the virtually $&#92;theta$-measurable, $&#92;theta$-strong and $&#92;theta$-supercompact cardinals, where the $&#92;theta$ in particular indicates that the generic embeddings have $H_&#92;theta^V$ as domain, and investigate how these level-by-level virtual large cardinals relate both to each other and to the existence of winning strategies in certain games. This is work in progress and joint with Philipp Schlicht.
