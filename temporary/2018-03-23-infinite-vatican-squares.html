abstract: "<p>In this talk I will discuss ongoing work with Matt Ollis and Gage Martin where we consider natural generalizations of Vatican squares from the finite to the infinite. We construct countable D-complete and Vatican squares using Cayley tables of groups. We show that there are Vatican squares of infinite order and that there is an uncountable semi-Vatican square based on R.
