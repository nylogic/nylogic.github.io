In this talk we will discuss some problems regarding adding linear order
isomorphisms between dense sets of reals via forcing. A set of reals $A
&#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb R$ is called $&#92;aleph_1$-<em>dense</em> just in case it
has intersection size $&#92;aleph_1$ with every nonempty open interval.
Famously Baumgartner showed in the 70s that consistently all
$&#92;aleph_1$-dense sets of reals are order isomorphic, thus establishing
the consistency of the natural analogue of Cantor's categoricity theorem
for countable dense linear orders at the uncountable. He later showed
the same statement follows from PFA. The statement 'all
$&#92;aleph_1$-dense sets of reals are isomorphic' is now known as
Baumgartner's axiom and denoted BA.
</p><p>
Baumgartner's argument is famously tricky and has several interesting
features. Given $&#92;aleph_1$-dense sets $A$ and $B$ he shows that under
the continuum hypothesis there is always a ccc partial order for making
them isomorphic - but here the CH is important (though it must fail in
the final model). Obviously it is therefore natural to ask whether the
CH is necessary and, similarly whether BA follows already from MA and
not just PFA. Avraham and Shelah showed the answer is 'no' to both&#58;
they produced a model of MA in which there is an $&#92;aleph_1$-dense set of
reals $A$ so that no ccc forcing notion can add an isomorphism between
$A$ and its reverse ordering. In the first part of this talk we will
strengthen this result by showing that MA is in fact consistent with an
$&#92;aleph_1$-dense linear order $A$ so that any partial order of size
$&#92;aleph_1$ which adds an isomorphism between $A$ and its reverse
ordering must collapse $&#92;aleph_1$. Thus it is consistent with MA that no
such order can even be proper. This part is joint work with Pedro Marun
and Saharon Shelah.
</p><p>
In another direction there is a natural generalization of BA to
non-ordered spaces, most notably higher dimensional Euclidean spaces
$&#92;mathbb R^n$ for $n > 1$ as well as compact $n$-dimensional manifolds.
Curiously, in these cases Steprans and Watson showed that the
corresponding BA statements do indeed follow from MA so the case of
dimension one is unique. In particular BA for $&#92;mathbb R^n$ with $n > 1$
does not imply the one dimensional case. They then conjectured that
conversely BA implies its higher dimensional analogues. In the second
part of the talk we will introduce some intrigue to this conjecture by
showing any 'reasonable' way of forcing BA - a very general adjective
that includes all known methods - must necessarily force the higher
dimensional versions and much more including large fragments of MA.
