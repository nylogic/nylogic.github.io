abstract: "<p>
The hypergraph containers theorem, introduced by Balogh-Morris-Samotij and Saxton-Thomason, is a breakthrough in extremal combinatorics which gives a tool for controlling the number of independent sets in finite hypergraphs.  (We do not assume any familiarity with the containers method!)  The original proof depends on giving a program which constructs 'containers' for independent sets and analyzing its behavior to ensure the construction has the right properties.  Inspired by the idea of pseudofinite dimension in ultraproducts, we give a new, elementary and nonalgorithmic, proof of the containers theorem which gives an direct characterization of the 'containers'.  Joint work with Bernshteyn, Delcourt, and Tserunyan.
