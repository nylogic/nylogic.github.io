abstract: "<p>
We consider effective Mathias forcing over a countable Turing ideal. In particular, we show  that a Mathias generic constructed with conditions from a countable ideal $&#92;mathcal{I}$ need not compute a Mathias generic over every smaller ideal $&#92;mathcal{J} &#92;subseteq &#92;mathcal{I}$, answering a question of Cholak, Dzhafarov, and Soskova. This is joint work with Henry Towsner and Dan Turetsky.
