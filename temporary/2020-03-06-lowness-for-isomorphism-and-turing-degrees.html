abstract: "<p>A Turing degree is low for isomorphism if whenever it can compute an isomorphism between two countably presented structures, there is already a computable isomorphism between them and thus there is no need to use the degree as an oracle at all. I will discuss the types of degrees that are low for isomorphism and the extent to which this class of degrees has the same properties as other lowness classes.</p>
<p>This work is joint with Reed Solomon.</p>"
