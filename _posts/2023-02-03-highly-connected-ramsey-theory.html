<p>
A typical Ramsey statement is the following: given a coloring of a complete graph, we aim to find a 'large' complete subgraph that is monochromatic. The weaker variation we are considering here (introduced by Bergfalk-Hrusak-Shelah) is to relax the 'complete subgraph' in the goal. More precisely, we aim to find a certain 'large' connected monochromatic subgraph. We will discuss the motivation and the connections with other combinatorial and algebraic problems. We demonstrate consistently, such partition relations can hold at small uncountable cardinals like aleph_2, and successors of singular cardinals like aleph_{omega+1}. Joint work with Hrusak and Shelah.
