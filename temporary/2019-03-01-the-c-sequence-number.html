abstract: "<p>
The C-sequence number of an uncountable regular cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is a cardinal invariant 
that provides a measure of the amount of compactness that holds at $&#92;kappa$. We will begin this talk by 
introducing the C-sequence number and proving some of its basic properties, linking it to familiar 
notions including large cardinals and square principles. We will then outline a number of consistency 
results regarding the C-sequence number at inaccessible cardinals and successors of singular cardinals. 
We will end by exploring how the C-sequence number interacts with the existence of complicated colorings 
and the infinite productivity of the $&#92;kappa$-Knaster condition. This is joint work with Assaf Rinot.
