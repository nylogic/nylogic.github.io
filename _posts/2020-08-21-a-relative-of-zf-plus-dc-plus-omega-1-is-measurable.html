abstract: " Let $&#92;Phi$ be the statement that for any function $f: &#92;omega_1 &#92;times &#92;omega_1 &#92;to &#92;omega$, there are functions $g_1, g_2 : &#92;omega_1 &#92;to &#92;omega$ such that for all $(x,y) &#92;in &#92;omega_1 &#92;times &#92;omega_1$, we have $f(x,y) &#92;le &#92;text{max }&#92;{g_1(x), g_2(y)&#92;}$.  We will show that $&#92;Phi$ follows from ${&#92;rm ZF} + {&#92;rm DC} + `&#92;omega_1&#92;text{ is measurable'}$.  On the other hand using core models, we will show that $&#92;Phi + `&#92;text{the club filter on }&#92;omega_1&#92;text{ is normal'}$ implies there are inner models with many measurable cardinals.  We conjecture that $&#92;Phi$ and ${&#92;rm ZF} + {&#92;rm DC} + `&#92;omega_1&#92;text{ is measurable'}$ have the same consistency strength. The research is joint with Francois Dorais at the University of Vermont."
