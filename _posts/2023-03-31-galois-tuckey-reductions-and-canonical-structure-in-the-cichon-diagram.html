Cardinal invariants of the continuum are cardinal numbers which,
roughly, measure how 'badly' CH fails in various mathematical contexts
such as analysis and topology. For instance the cardinal ${&#92;rm
add}(&#92;mathcal N)$ is the least $&#92;kappa$ for which there are $&#92;kappa$
many Lebesgue measure zero sets of reals whose union is not measure
zero. Classical facts imply $&#92;aleph_1 &#92;leq {&#92;rm add}(&#92;mathcal N) &#92;leq
2^{&#92;aleph_0}$ but the precise value is undetermined in ZFC and depends
heavily on the axioms of set theory. Other numbers follow a similar
pattern of 'the least size of a set of reals (Borel sets, etc) lacking
a classical smallness property'.

The Cichoń diagram displays cardinal invariants related to Lebesgue
measure (the null ideal), Baire category (the meager ideal) as well as
the bounding and dominating numbers which concern growth rates of
functions. Many surprising ZFC-inequalities exist between these
cardinals suggesting a rich world living on the reals in various models
of set theory. At the combinatorial heart of every proof of a ZFC
inequality derives from a Galois-Tukey reduction: the (ZFC-provable)
existence of a pair of continuous maps with simple properties that make
sense outside of the context of logic and indeed would be sensible to
any analyst or topologist.</p>

In this talk we will discuss some recent work in progress on the
descriptive complexity of maps witnessing consistent but non-provable
implications. We will show using largely computability theoretic methods
that in Gödel's constructible universe there are low level projective
reductions between any two cardinal invariants - thus CH holds in a very
'definable' way, while in Solovay's model of 'all sets of reals are
Lebesgue measurable' (and therefore the axiom of choice fails) there are
no non-ZFC provable implications thus these cardinals are all as
different as possible.
