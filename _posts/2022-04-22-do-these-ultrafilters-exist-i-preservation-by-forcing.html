<p>
This is the first of two talks devoted to two properties of
ultrafilters (non-principal, on omega) for which the question 'Do such
ultrafilters exist?' is open. In this talk, I'll discuss the property
of being preserved by some forcing that adds new reals. Some forcings
destroy all ultrafilters, and some (in fact many) ultrafilters are
destroyed whenever new reals are added, but it is consistent with ZFC
that some ultrafilters are preserved when some kinds of reals are
added. I plan to prove some of these things and describe the rest.
I'll also describe a combinatorial characterization, due to Arnie
Miller, of preservable ultrafilters.
