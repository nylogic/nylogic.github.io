<p>
We present new results regarding the depth and Tukey spectrum of general ultrafilters and simple<br> $P_&#92;lambda$-points at a measurable cardinal. In particular we prove that on a measurable cardinal there can only be a single $&#92;lambda$ for which there exists a simple $P_&#92;lambda$-point - this is in sharp contrast to $&#92;omega$. Finally we will present several models in which we analyze the depth and Tukey spectrum of an ultrafilter, and their effect on generalized cardinal characteristics.
