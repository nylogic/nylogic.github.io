abstract: "In this talk, we will review Morley's 1963 article 'Omitting Classes of Elements' (in modern parlance, omitting types). In this paper, Morley investigates the question of how large a structure's cardinality must be before it is forced to realize a type (for example, an ordered field with cardinality greater than the continuum must contain non-Archimedean elements). Given a fixed language, there is a cardinal $&#92;kappa$ such that for every theory $T$ and any type $&#92;Sigma$, if $T$ has a model of size $&#92;kappa$ omitting $&#92;Sigma$ then it has such a model in every cardinality. Morley's main result is that given a countable language $L$, if for every $&#92;alpha < &#92;omega_1$ there is a model of $T$ of size $&#92;geq &#92;beth_&#92;alpha$ which omits $&#92;Sigma$, then there is such a model in every cardinality (and if $L$ has at most $&#92;aleph_&#92;beta$ symbols, we replace '$&#92;omega_1$' in this statement by '$&#92;omega_{&#92;gamma + 1}$' where $2^{&#92;aleph_&#92;beta} = &#92;aleph_&#92;gamma$). The proof uses the Erdős–Rado partition theorem and indiscernible sequences."
