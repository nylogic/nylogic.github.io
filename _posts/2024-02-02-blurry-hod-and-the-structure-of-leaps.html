<p>
For a cardinal $&#92;kappa&#92;ge 2$, one can weaken the concept 'x is ordinal definable' (i.e., x is the unique object satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters) to 'x is $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable,' meaning that x is one of fewer than $&#92;kappa$ many objects satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters. By considering the hereditary version of this, one naturally arrives at the inner model $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-HOD, the class of all hereditarily $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable sets. In ZFC, by varying $&#92;kappa$, one obtains a hierarchy of inner models spanning all the way from HOD to V. The leaps are those stages in the hierarchy where something new is added. I have previously given a logic workshop talk about the basic theory of the blurry HOD hierarchy, and in this talk, after reviewing the basics, I want to focus on the consistency strengths of certain leap constellations, ranging from outright consistent, to equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal, to inconsistent.
