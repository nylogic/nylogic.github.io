We consider the game of infinite Wordle as played on Baire space $&#92;omega^&#92;omega$. The codebreaker can win in finitely many moves against any countable dictionary $&#92;Delta&#92;subseteq&#92;omega^&#92;omega$, but not against the full dictionary of Baire space. The <i>Wordle number</i> is the size of the smallest dictionary admitting such a winning strategy for the codebreaker, the corresponding <i>Wordle ideal</i> is the ideal generated by these dictionaries, which under MA includes all dictionaries of size less than the continuum. The <i>Absurdle number</i>, meanwhile, is the size of the smallest dictionary admitting a winning strategy for the absurdist in the two-player variant, infinite Absurdle. In ZFC there are nondetermined Absurdle games, with neither player having a winning strategy, but if one drops the axiom of choice, then the principle of Absurdle determinacy has large cardinal consistency strength over ZF+DC. This is joint work with Ben De Bondt (Paris).
