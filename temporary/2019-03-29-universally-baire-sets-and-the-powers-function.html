abstract: "<p>
Can we define powerset(kappa) using the uB sets? Woodin showed that this cannot be done once there are supercompacts in the universe. 
Trang and the speaker recently showed that this cannot be done even much below than supercompacts, at the level of a Woodin cardinal that is a limit of Woodin cardinals. We will then discuss what powerset(kappa) could be.
