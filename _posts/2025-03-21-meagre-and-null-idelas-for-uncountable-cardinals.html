<p>
We will consider the space of functions from $&#92;lambda$ to $&#92;kappa$ for
various choices of $&#92;lambda$ and $&#92;kappa$.
In the first part of the talk we define topologies on such spaces and
discuss the $&#92;mu$-meagre ideal (i.e. sets that are unions of $&#92;mu$-many
nowhere dense sets), and their associated cardinal invariants.
In the second part, we will look at various ways to consider (cardinal
invariants of) the null ideal on such spaces.
