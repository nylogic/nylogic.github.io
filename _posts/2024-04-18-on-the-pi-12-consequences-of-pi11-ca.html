<p>
(This is a joint work with Keita Yokoyama) Some recent studies in reverse mathematics focus on theorems that are stronger than $&#92;mathsf{ATR}_0$ and weaker than $&#92;Pi^1_1$-$&#92;mathsf{CA}_0$.
Especially, theorems represented by a $&#92;Pi^1_2$ sentence and provable from $&#92;Pi^1_1$-$&#92;mathsf{CA}_0$ are investigated.
In this talk, we will introduce a hierarchy slicing the set
$&#92;{&#92;sigma &#92;in &#92;Pi^1_2: &#92;Pi^1_1&#92;text{-}&#92;mathsf{CA}_0&#92;}$.
Then, we show that Ramsey's theorem for $&#92;Sigma^0_2,&#92;Sigma^0_3,&#92;Sigma^0_4,&#92;ldots$ sets are separated in a sense although all of them are equivalent to $&#92;Pi^1_1$-$&#92;mathsf{CA}_0$
by comparing this hierarchy and a suitable weaker variant of those theorems.
We also show that a similar result holds for $(&#92;Sigma^0_1)_n$ determinacy.
