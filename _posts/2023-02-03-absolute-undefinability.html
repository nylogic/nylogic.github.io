<p>
I call a subset of the domain of a countable model absolutely undefinable if  the set of its images under automorphisms of the model is uncountable. By the Kueker-Reyes theorem, all sets that are not absolutely undefinable are parametrically definable in $L_{&#92;omega_1 &#92;omega}$.  I will survey classical results about first-order undefinability in the standard model of arithmetic, and I will contrast them with some old and some new results about absolute undefinability in nonstandard models of PA.​
