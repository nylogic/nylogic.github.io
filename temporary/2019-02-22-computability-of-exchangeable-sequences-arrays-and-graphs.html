abstract: "<p>
A sequence of random variables is exchangeable when its distribution
is invariant to reorderings of the sequence. This notion of symmetry
and its generalizations to arrays, graphs, and other structures, arise
in many statistical contexts. Representation theorems due to de
Finetti, Aldous-Hoover, and others, describe how exchangeable
structures can be written in a way that exposes conditional
independence, which is often important for computational purposes.
However, these results are not obviously computable. We will present
several positive and negative results examining the computable content
of these theorems, and will also describe several implications for the
design of probabilistic programming languages. Joint work with
Nathanael Ackerman, Jeremy Avigad, Daniel Roy, and Jason Rute.â€‹
