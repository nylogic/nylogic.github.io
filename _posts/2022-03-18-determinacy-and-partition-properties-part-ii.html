<p>
In this talk, we will review some basic properties of partition cardinals under the axiom of determinacy. We will be particularly interested with the strong partition property of the first uncountable cardinal and the good coding system used to derive these partition properties. We will discuss almost everywhere behavior of functions on partition spaces of cardinals with respect to the partition measures including various almost everywhere continuity and monotonicity properties. These continuity results will be used to distinguish some cardinalities below the power set of partition cardinals. We will also use these continuity results to produce upper bounds on the ultrapower of the first uncountable cardinal by each of its partition measures, which addresses a question of Goldberg. Portions of the talk are joint work with Jackson and Trang.
