abstract: "<p>
An uncountable cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is strongly tall if it can be mapped arbitrarily high by ultrapower embeddings with critical point $&#92;kappa$. Hamkins asked whether all strongly tall cardinals are strongly compact. We give a positive answer assuming GCH and discuss recent work of Gitik that shows that this cardinal arithmetic assumption is necessary.
