<p>
Work in ZF and let $j:V_&#92;alpha&#92;to V_&#92;alpha$ be an elementary, or partially elementary, embedding. One can examine the degree of uniqueness, definability or constructibility of $j$. For example, is there $&#92;beta<&#92;alpha$ such that $j$ is the unique (partially) elementary extension of $j&#92;upharpoonright V_&#92;beta$? Is $j$ definable from parameters over $V_&#92;alpha$? We will discuss some results along these lines, illustrating that answers can depend heavily on circumstances. Some of the work is due independently and earlier to Gabriel Goldberg.
