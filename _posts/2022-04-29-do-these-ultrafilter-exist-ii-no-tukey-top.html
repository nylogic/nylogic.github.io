abstract: "
<p>This is the second of two talks devoted to two properties of
ultrafilters (non-principal, on omega) for which the question 'Do such
ultrafilters exist?' is open. In this talk, I'll discuss the property
of not being at the top of the Tukey ordering (of ultrafilters on
omega). I'll start with the definition of the Tukey ordering, and I'll
give an example of an ultrafilter that is 'Tukey top'. It's consistent
with ZFC that some ultrafilters are not Tukey top. The examples and
the combinatorial characterizations involved here are remarkably
similar but not identical to examples and the characterization from
the previous talk. That observation suggests some conjectures, one of
which I'll disprove if there's enough time.
