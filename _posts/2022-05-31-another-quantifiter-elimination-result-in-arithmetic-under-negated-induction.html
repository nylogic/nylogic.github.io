<p>
In a paper published in 1990, Kossak showed that all countable models of $&#92;Sigma_n$ collection where $&#92;Sigma_n$ induction fails have continuum-many automorphisms.  We extract from his proof a(nother) quantifier-elimination result.  This gives new information about pigeonhole principles and expansions to second-order models.  The work is joint with David Belanger, CT Chong, Wei Li, and Yue Yang at the National University of Singapore.
