<p>
On the basis of Poincaré and Weyl's view of predicativity as
invariance, we develop an extensive framework for predicative,
type-free first-order set theory in which $&#92;Gamma_0$ and much bigger
ordinals can be defined as von Neumann ordinals. This refutes the
accepted view of $&#92;Gamma_0$ as the 'limit of predicativity.' We also
explain what is wrong in Feferman-Schütte analysis of predicativity
on which this view of $&#92;Gamma_0$ is based.
