One of the strongest second-order arithmetic systems is <em>full second-order arithmetic</em> ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ which asserts that every second-order formula (with any number of set quantifiers) defines a set. We can augment ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ with choice principles such as the choice scheme and the dependent choice scheme. The $&#92;Sigma^1_n$-<em>choice scheme</em> asserts for every $&#92;Sigma^1_n$-formula $&#92;varphi(n,X)$ that if for every $n$, there is a set $X$ witnessing $&#92;varphi(n,X)$, then there is a single set $Z$ whose $n$-th slice $Z_n$ is a witness for $&#92;varphi(n,X)$. The $&#92;Sigma^1_n$-<em>dependent choice scheme</em> asserts that every $&#92;Sigma^1_n$-relation $&#92;varphi(X,Y)$ without terminal nodes has an infinite branch: there is a set $Z$ such that $&#92;varphi(Z_n,Z_{n+1})$ holds for all $n$. The system ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ proves the $&#92;Sigma^1_2$-choice scheme and the $&#92;Sigma^1_2$-dependent choice scheme. The independence of $&#92;Pi^1_2$-choice scheme from ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ follows by taking a model of ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ whose sets are the reals of the Feferman-Levy model of ${&#92;rm ZF}$ in which every $&#92;aleph_n^L$ is countable and $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega^L$ is the first uncountable cardinal.

We construct a model of ${&#92;rm ZF}+{&#92;rm AC}_&#92;omega$ whose reals give a model of ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ together with the full choice scheme in which $&#92;Pi^1_2$-dependent choice fails. This result was first proved by Kanovei in 1979 and published in Russian. It was rediscovered by Sy Friedman and myself with a slightly simplified proof.
