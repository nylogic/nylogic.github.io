I shall introduce and consider the natural infinitary variations of Wordle, Absurdle, and Mastermind. Infinite Wordle extends the familiar finite game to infinite words and transfinite play—the code-breaker aims to discover a hidden codeword selected from a dictionary $&#92;Delta&#92;subseteq&#92;Sigma^&#92;omega$ of infinite words over a countable alphabet $&#92;Sigma$ by making a sequence of successive guesswords, receiving feedback after each guess concerning its accuracy. For any dictionary using the usual 26-letter alphabet, for example, the code-breaker can win in at most 26 guesses, and more generally in $n$ guesses for alphabets of finite size $n$. Meanwhile, for some dictionaries on an infinite alphabet, infinite play is required, but the code-breaker can always win by stage $&#92;omega$ on a countable alphabet, for any fixed dictionary. Infinite Mastermind, in contrast, is a subtler game than Wordle because only the number and not the position of correct bits is given. When duplication of colors is allowed, nevertheless, then the code-breaker can still always win by stage $&#92;omega$, but in the no-duplication variation, no countable number of guesses (even transfinite) is sufficient for the code-breaker to win. I therefore introduce the <em>mastermind number</em>, denoted $&#92;frak{mm}$, to be the size of the smallest winning no-duplication Mastermind guessing set, a new cardinal characteristic of the continuum, which I prove is bounded below by the additivity number $&#92;text{add}(&#92;mathcal{M})$ of the meager ideal and bounded above by the covering number $&#92;text{cov}(&#92;mathcal{M})$. In particular, the precise value of the mastermind number is independent of ZFC and can consistently be strictly between $&#92;aleph_1$ and the continuum $2^{&#92;aleph_0}$. In <em>simplified Mastermind</em>, where the feedback given at each stage includes only the numbers of correct and incorrect bits (omitting information about rearrangements), then the corresponding simplified mastermind number is exactly the eventually different number $&#92;frak{d}(&#92;neq^*)$.  <a href='http://jdh.hamkins.org/infinite-wordle-and-the-mastermind-numbers-cuny-logic-workshop-march-2022/'>http://jdh.hamkins.org/infinite-wordle-and-the-mastermind-numbers-cuny-logic-workshop-march-2022/</a>
