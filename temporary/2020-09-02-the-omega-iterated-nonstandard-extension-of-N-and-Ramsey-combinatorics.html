<p>
In the theory of nonstandard methods (traditionally known as nonstandard analysis),
each mathematical object (a set) $x$ has a uniquely determined so called nonstandard
extension ${}^*x$. In general, ${}^*x &#92;supsetneq &#92;{{}^*y; y&#92;in x&#92;}$ - that is, 
besides the original 'standard' elements ${}^*y$ for $y&#92;in x$,  the set ${}^*x$ 
contains some new 'nonstandard' elements. </p>
<p>
For instance, some of the nonstandard elements of ${}^*&#92;mathbb{R}$ can be interpreted 
as infinitesimals (there is $&#92;varepsilon&#92;in {}^*&#92;mathbb{R}$ such that 
$0<&#92;varepsilon<1/n$ for all $n&#92;in&#92;mathbb{N}$) allowing for nonstandard analysis
to be developed in ${}^*&#92;mathbb{R}$, while ${}^*&#92;mathbb{N}$ 
turns out to be an (at least $&#92;aleph_1$-saturated) nonstandard elementary extension
of $&#92;mathbb{N}$ (in the language of arithmetic).</p>
<p>
While the whole nonstandard real analysis is most naturally developed in ${}^*&#92;mathbb{R}$
(with just a few advanced topics where using the second extension ${}^{**}&#92;mathbb{R}$
is convenient, though far from necessary), recent successful applications of 
nonstandard methods in combinatorics on $&#92;mathbb{N}$ have utilized also higher order
extensions ${}^{(n)*}&#92;mathbb{N} = {}^{***&#92;cdots *}&#92;mathbb{N}$ with the chain $***&#92;cdots *$
of length $n>2$.</p>
<p>
In this talk we are going to study the structure of the $&#92;omega$-iterated nonstandard 
extension ${}^{&#92;cdot}&#92;mathbb{N} = &#92;bigcup_{n&#92;in&#92;omega} {}^{(n)*}&#92;mathbb{N}$ of $&#92;mathbb{N}$
and show how the obtained results shed new light on the complexities of Ramsey 
combinatorics on $&#92;mathbb{N}$ and allow us to drastically simplify proofs of 
many advanced Ramsey type theorems such as Hindmann's or Milliken's and Taylor's.</p>
