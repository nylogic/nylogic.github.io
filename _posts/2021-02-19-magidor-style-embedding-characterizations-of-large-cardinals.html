<p>
Motivated by a classical theorem of Magidor, I will present results providing characterizations of important objects from the lower end of the large cardinal hierarchy through the existence of elementary embeddings between  set-sized models that map their critical point to the large cardinal in question. Focusing on the characterization of <em>shrewd cardinals</em>, introduced by Rathjen in a proof-theoretic context, I will show how these results  can be used in the study of the combinatorics of strong chain conditions and the investigation of <em>principles of structural reflection</em> formulated by Bagaria.
