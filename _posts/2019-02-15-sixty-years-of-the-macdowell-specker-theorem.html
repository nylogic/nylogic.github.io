abstract: "<p>
In 1959, MacDowell and Specker proved that every model of Peano Arithmetic
has an elementary end extension. Since then, the theorem has been a constant source
of new results, as well as a subject of extensions and generalizations. I will give a quick 
survey of those developments, including some very recent results.
