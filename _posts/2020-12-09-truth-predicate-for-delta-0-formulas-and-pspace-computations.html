abstract: "
<p>We consider a bounded arithmetic in Buss's language
enriched with a predicate Tr which is assumed to
be a truth definition for bounded sentences.
Among other things we assume polynomial  
induction for $&#92;Sigma^b_1(&#92;text{Tr})$ formulas. 
We show that such an arithmetic captures PSPACE. 
We prove a witnessing theorem for such an arithmetic by an interpretation
of free-cuts free proofs  of strict $&#92;Sigma^{1,b}_1$ in $U^{1,*}_2$, a canonical
second order arithmetic capturing PSPACE.
It follows that the problem of the existence 
of a truth definition for $&#92;Delta_0$ sentences without the totality
of $&#92;exp$ might be more about separating  subexponential time alternation
hierarchies from PSPACE.  </p>

The presentation is based on the following article:

Truth definition for $&#92;Delta_0$ formulas and PSPACE computations,
