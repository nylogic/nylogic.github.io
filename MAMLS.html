<p>
The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar is an ongoing program of grass-roots meetings in mathematical logic in the northeastern United States.  It is funded by grant #DMS-1834219 from the National Science Foundation, which provides travel support for speakers, students, and researchers without other means of support, so that they can attend MAMLS meetings.  The Principal Investigator for this grant is Prof. Russell Miller, of Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center, and the grant is administered by the Research Foundation of CUNY.  For many years, Prof. Arthur Apter was the mainstay of the MAMLS grant, and we salute his efforts through those years.

<p>
The meetings funded by MAMLS include several recurring conference series:  the New England Recursion and Definability Seminar (<a href="https://nerds.math.uconn.edu/">NERDS</a>), the Groups Logic and Dynamics meeting (<a href='https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~fc327/GLaDF2023/index.html'>GLaD</a>), and the annual Rutgers Logic Meeting.  In addition, wild-card MAMLS meetings take place intermittently.  Below we provide a list of recent and upcoming meetings funded by MAMLS.  Students and others who wish to apply for MAMLS funding to attend one of these meetings should initiate the process by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:Russell.Miller@qc.cuny.edu">Russell Miller</a>.

<h2><strong>MAMLS Meetings</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><a href='https://nerds.math.uconn.edu/nerds-24-0/'>NERDS</a></strong></h3>
<p>
The Autumn 2023 meeting of NERDS (the New England Recursion and Definability Seminar) will be held on October 14 at Wellesley College, in Wellesley, MA, near Boston.  The speakers will be Caleb Camrud (Brown University), Matthew Jura (Manhattan College), Neil Lutz (Swarthmore College), Gihanee Senadheera (Winthrop College), and Alex van Abel (Wesleyan University).  The schedule and further information will be available on the NERDS <a href='https://nerds.math.uconn.edu/nerds-24-0/'>website</a>. 
</p><p>
NERDS meetings occur twice a year, with a focus on computability theory, broadly interpreted.  They are open to all interested scholars in the region, regardless of your background or level in logic, and we encourage everyone connected with logic and computability to attend, learn something new, and make some logician friends.  Some travel funding is available, thanks to the NSF grant supporting MAMLS.  Anyone who is interested in attending and needs support for travel to NERDS should contact <a href='mailto:Russell.Miller@qc.cuny.edu'>Russell Miller</a>.

<h3><strong><a href='https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~fc327/GLaDF2023/index.html'>GLaD</a></strong></h3>
<p>
The meeting "Groups, Logic and Dynamics - Spring 2024" (GLaD) will meet at Rutgers in New Brunswick (NJ) on March 23, at the beginning of the spring season. The speakers will be Sahana Balasubramanya (Lafayette College), Turbo Ho (UC Riverside), Antoine Poulin (McGill), and Nicholas Vlamis (Queens College CUNY). 
</p><p>
The main goal of GLaD is bringing together people working in different areas, with common interest in groups and their actions and build a community. The scope of the meeting is very broad. It includes descriptive set theory, dynamics, geometric and measured group theory. GLaD is open to all interested scholars in the region. Students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to participate. The meeting is partially funded by the NSF grant supporting MAMLS. Anyone who is interested in attending and needs support for travel to GLaD should contact <a href="mailto:filippo.calderoni@rutgers.edu">Filippo Calderoni</a> and  <a href="mailto:Russell.Miller@qc.cuny.edu">Russell Miller</a>.</p>
