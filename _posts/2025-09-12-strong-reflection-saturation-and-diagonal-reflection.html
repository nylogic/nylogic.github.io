<p>
There is a natural way to formulate fragments of Todorcevicâ€™s strong reflection principle (SRP) which are associated to forcing classes more restrictive than the class of all stationary set preserving forcing notions. The fragment associated to the subcomplete forcings (SC-SRP), while retaining many crucial consequences of SRP, is compatible with CH, and even Jensen's Diamond Principle. In particular, the saturation of the nonstationary ideal, a celebrated consequence of SRP, does not follow from its subcomplete fragment. In fact, adding CH to  SC-SRP results in a principle which outright contradicts the saturation of the nonstationary ideal. A specific form of diagonal reflection of stationary sets of ordinal was used by Paul Larson to separate SRP from Martin's Maximum: that form of diagonal reflection follows from MM, but not from SRP. The surprising initial observation is that it does follow from SC-SRP + CH. The key reason for this is that SC-SRP + CH implies the nonsaturation of the nonstationary ideal. Thus, an apparent weakness of SC-SRP + CH turns out to be a strength in this context.</p>
<p>
I will introduce the concepts involved and present some further results along these lines. The picture that emerges is that in the context of SC-SRP, saturation and diagonal reflection work against each other.</p><p>
This is joint work with Hiroshi Sakai.
