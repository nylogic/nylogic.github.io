abstract: "A subset $X$ of a cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is Ramsey if for every function $f:[X]^{<&#92;omega}&#92;rightarrow 2$ there is a set $H&#92;subseteq X$ of cardinality $&#92;kappa$ which is homogeneous for $f$, meaning that $f&#92;upharpoonright[H]^n$ is constant for each $n<&#92;omega$. Baumgartner proved that if $&#92;kappa$ is Ramsey, then the collection of non-Ramsey subsets of $&#92;kappa$ is a normal ideal on $&#92;kappa$. We will discuss some recent results concerning Ramsey properties in which homogeneous sets are demanded to be indescribable of a particular degree. Moreover, by iterating Feng's Ramsey operator, which he used to define a notion of $&#92;alpha$-Ramseyness of a cardinal $&#92;kappa$, we will consider hypotheses in which homogeneous sets themselves satisfy various Ramsey properties. For ordinals $&#92;alpha,&#92;beta<&#92;kappa$ we will define a notion of $&#92;alpha$-$&#92;Pi^1_&#92;beta$-Ramseyness of a cardinal $&#92;kappa$ where $&#92;alpha$ indicates how many times the Ramsey operator has been iterated and $&#92;beta$ indicates the degree of transfinite indescribability (due to Sharpe-Welch and independently Bagaria) one initially demands homogeneous to satisfy. We will prove that for $&#92;alpha,&#92;beta<&#92;kappa$ an $&#92;alpha$-$&#92;Pi^1_&#92;beta$-Ramsey cardinal is strictly between Feng's $&#92;alpha$-Ramsey and an ($&#92;alpha+1$)-Ramsey cardinal in consistency strength. Moreover, for fixed $&#92;alpha<&#92;kappa$, as $&#92;beta$ increases the $&#92;alpha$-$&#92;Pi^1_&#92;beta$-Ramsey cardinals yield a strictly increasing hierarchy, in a somewhat subtle sense. For $&#92;beta_0<&#92;beta_1<&#92;kappa$ and for large enough $&#92;alpha<&#92;kappa$, $&#92;kappa$ being $&#92;alpha$-$&#92;Pi^1_{&#92;beta_0}$-Ramsey is equivalent to $&#92;kappa$ being $&#92;alpha$-$&#92;Pi^1_{&#92;beta_1}$-Ramsey (we will identify the least $&#92;alpha$ at which this equivalence occurs). But if $&#92;alpha,&#92;beta_0<&#92;kappa$ there is a large enough $&#92;beta_1<&#92;kappa$ such that $&#92;kappa$ being $&#92;alpha$-$&#92;Pi^1_{&#92;beta_0}$-Ramsey is strictly weaker than $&#92;kappa$ being $&#92;alpha$-$&#92;Pi^1_{&#92;beta_1}$-Ramsey. All of these results seem to require a careful analysis of the ideals associated to the various large cardinal notions."
