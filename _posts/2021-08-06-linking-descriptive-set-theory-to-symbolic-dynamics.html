<p>1. I'll begin by reviewing the work I did in 1993-6 on a problem raised by
the dynamics group at the Universidad Autonomoa de Barcelona. They
were interested in a phenomenon that resembles the Cantor-Bendixson
sequence of derivatives, and hoped to prove that the sequence would
always stop at a countable stage. Using ideas of Kunen and Martin
I showed that it would always stop at or before stage omega_1.</p>

<p>2. In 2002/3, alerted by observations of David Fremlin, to the possibility
that the barcelona conjecture was false, I succeeded in constructing an
example with recursive initial data  where the sequence stops exactly at
stage omega_1.</p>

<p>My Réunion colleague Chrstian Delhommé simplified and extended my ideas.</p>

<p>I'll outline the construction, as I think the underlying idea might have
applications elsewhere in descriptive set theory.</p>

<p>3. I will outline more recent work using ideas of Blass and Fremlin to
to study 'uniform' versions of the results of 1993-96.</p>

<p>I'll end with listing some open problems which I hope will be found
interesting.</p>
