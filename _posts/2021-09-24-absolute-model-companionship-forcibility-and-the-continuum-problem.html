Absolute model companionship (AMC) is a strengthening of model companionship defined as follows:
For a theory $T$, $T_{&#92;exists&#92;vee&#92;forall}$ denotes the logical consequences of $T$ which are boolean combinations of universal sentences.
$T^*$ is the AMC of $T$ if it is model complete and $T_{&#92;exists&#92;vee&#92;forall}=T^*_{&#92;exists&#92;vee&#92;forall}$.
The $&#92;{+,&#92;cdot,0,1&#92;}$-theory $&#92;mathsf{ACF}$ of algebraically closed field is the model companion of the theory of $&#92;mathsf{Fields}$ but not its 
AMC as $&#92;exists x(x^2+1=0)&#92;in &#92;mathsf{ACF}_{&#92;exists&#92;vee&#92;forall}&#92;setminus &#92;mathsf{Fields}_{&#92;exists&#92;vee&#92;forall}$. 
Any model complete theory $T$ is the AMC of $T_{&#92;exists&#92;vee&#92;forall}$.
We use AMC to study the continuum problem and to gauge the expressive power of forcing.
We show that (a definable version of) $2^{&#92;aleph_0}=&#92;aleph_2$ is the unique solution to the continuum problem which can be in the AMC of a <em>partial Morleyization</em> of the $&#92;in$-theory $&#92;mathsf{ZFC}+$<em>there are class many supercompact cardinals</em>.
We also show that (assuming large cardinals) 
forcibility overlaps with the apparently weaker notion of consistency for any mathematical problem $&#92;psi$ expressible as a $&#92;Pi_2$-sentence of a (very large fragment of) third order arithmetic
($&#92;mathsf{CH}$, the Suslin hypothesis, the Whitehead conjecture for free groups are a small sample of such problems $&#92;psi$).
Partial Morleyizations can be described as follows: let $&#92;mathsf{Form}_{&#92;tau}$ be the set of first order $&#92;tau$-formulae;
for $A&#92;subseteq &#92;mathsf{Form}_&#92;tau$, $&#92;tau_A$ is the expansion of $&#92;tau$ adding atomic relation symbols $R_&#92;phi$ for all formulae $&#92;phi$ in $A$ and $T_{&#92;tau,A}$ is the $&#92;tau_A$-theory asserting that each $&#92;tau$-formula 
$&#92;phi(&#92;vec{x})&#92;in A$
is logically equivalent to the corresponding atomic formula $R_&#92;phi(&#92;vec{x})$. For a $&#92;tau$-theory $T$ $T+T_{&#92;tau,A}$ is the <em>partial Morleyization</em> of $T$ induced by $A&#92;subseteq &#92;mathsf{Form}_&#92;tau$.
