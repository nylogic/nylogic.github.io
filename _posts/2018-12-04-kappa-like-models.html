abstract: "<p>
A model $(M, < ,&#92;ldots)$ is said to be $&#92;kappa$-like if $|M| = &#92;kappa$ but for all $a &#92;in M$, $|&#92;{x &#92;in M &#92;mid x < a&#92;}| < &#92;kappa$. Based on the paper, the theory of $&#92;kappa$-like models of arithmetic by R. Kaye, we will identify some axiom schemes true in such models of $I&#92;Delta_0$ and investigate their interesting properties. â€‹
