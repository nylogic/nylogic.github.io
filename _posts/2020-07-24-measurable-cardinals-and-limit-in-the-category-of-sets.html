abstract: "An old result of Isbell characterises measurable cardinals in terms of certain canonical limits in the category of sets.  After introducing this characterisation, I will talk about recent work with Adamek, Campion, Positselski and Rosicky teasing out the importance of the canonicity for this and related results.  The language will be category-theoretic but the proofs will be quite hands-on combinatorial constructions with sets."
