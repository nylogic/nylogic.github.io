<p>
We investigate the end extendibility of models of arithmetic with restricted elementarity. By utilizing the restricted ultrapower construction in the second-order context, for each $n &#92;in &#92;mathbb{N}$ and any countable model of $&#92;mathrm{B}&#92;Sigma_{n+2}$, we construct a proper $&#92;Sigma_{n+2}$-elementary end extension satisfying $&#92;mathrm{B}&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$, which answers a question by Clote positively. We also give a characterization of countable models of $&#92;mathrm{I}&#92;Sigma_{n+2}$ in terms of their end extendibility similar to the case of $&#92;mathrm{B}&#92;Sigma_{n+2}$. Along the proof, we will introduce a new type of regularity principles in arithmetic called the weak regularity principle, which serves as a bridge between the model's end extendibility and the amount of induction or collection it satisfies.<br>
