abstract: "<p>
Several years ago I introduced the Diagonal Reflection Principle (DRP), a maximal form of simultaneous stationary reflection.  Roughly, DRP asserts that for all regular $&#92;theta &#92;ge &#92;omega_2$, there are stationarily many sets $W$ of size $&#92;omega_1$ such that every stationary element of $W$ reflects to $W$ (i.e. if $S &#92;subset [&#92;theta]^&#92;omega$ is stationary and $S &#92;in W$, then $S &#92;cap [W &#92;cap &#92;theta]^&#92;omega$ is stationary).  In that paper I showed that that $&#92;text{MM}^{+&#92;omega_1}$--even just the '$+&#92;omega_1$' version of the forcing axiom for $&#92;sigma$-closed forcings--implies DRP.  In this talk I will prove that MM, even its technical strengthening $&#92;text{MM}^{+&#92;omega}$, does NOT imply DRP, contrary to my initial expectations.  This is joint work with Hiroshi Sakai.
