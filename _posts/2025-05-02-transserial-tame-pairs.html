<p>
Interest in transseries and Hardy fields comes from several fields,
including asymptotic analysis, dynamical systems, and model theory of
the real numbers. The first-order theory of (logarithmic-exponential)
transseries and maximal Hardy fields is completely axiomatized by the
theory of closed H-fields, which is model complete, as Aschenbrenner,
Van den Dries, and Van der Hoeven have shown in a long series of works.
I will describe my extension of this model completeness to tame pairs of
closed H-fields, in order to better understand large closed H-fields,
such as maximal Hardy fields, hyperseries, or surreal numbers. Time
permitting, I may mention ongoing work on differential-algebraic
dimension in transserial tame pairs.
