<p>
We put together Woodin's $ &#92;Sigma^2_1$ basis theorem of $AD^+$ and VopÄ›nka's theorem to conclude the following: If there is a proper class of Woodin cardinals, then every $(&#92;Sigma^2_1)^{uB}$ statement that is true in V is true in HOD. Moreover, this is true even if we allow a certain parameter. We then show that stronger absoluteness cannot be implied by any large cardinal axiom consistent with the axiom V = Ultimate L.
