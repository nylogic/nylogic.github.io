abstract: "<p>Starting from a model of ZFC with two supercompact cardinals, I will
discuss how to force and construct a model in which the first two strongly compact
cardinals $&#92;kappa_1$ and $&#92;kappa_2$ are also the first two measurable cardinals.
In this model, $&#92;kappa_1$'s strong compactness is indestructible under arbitrary
$&#92;kappa_1$-directed closed forcing, and $&#92;kappa_2$'s strong compactness is
indestructible under ${&#92;rm Add}(&#92;kappa_2, &#92;lambda)$ for any ordinal $&#92;lambda$. This
answers a generalized version of a question of Sargsyan.</p>
