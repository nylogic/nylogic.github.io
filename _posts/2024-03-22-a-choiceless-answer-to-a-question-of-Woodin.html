In a lecture presented in July 2023, Moti Gitik
discussed the following question from the 1980s due to Woodin,
as well as approaches to its solution and why it is so difficult to solve&#58;
</p>
Question&#58; Assuming there is no inner model of ZFC with a strong cardinal, is it possible
to have a model $M$ of ZFC such that $M &#92;vDash$'$2^{&#92;aleph_&#92;omega} > &#92;aleph_{&#92;omega + 2}$ and
$2^{&#92;aleph_n} = &#92;aleph_{n + 1}$ for every $n &#92;lt&#92;omega$',
together with the existence of an inner model
$N^* &#92;subseteq M$ of ZFC such that for the $&#92;gamma, &#92;delta$ so that
$&#92;gamma = (&#92;aleph_&#92;omega)^M$ and $&#92;delta = (&#92;aleph_{&#92;omega + 3})^M,$
$N^* &#92;vDash$'$&#92;gamma$ is measurable and $2^&#92;gamma &#92;ge &#92;delta$'?
</p>
<p>
I will discuss how to find answers to this question, if we drop
the requirement that $M$ satisfies the Axiom of Choice.
I will also briefly discuss the phenomenon
that on occasion, when the Axiom of Choice is removed from consideration, a technically challenging
question or problem becomes more tractable.
One may, however, end up with models satisfying conclusions that are impossible
in ZFC.
