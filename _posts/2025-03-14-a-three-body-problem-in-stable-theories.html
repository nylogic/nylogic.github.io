<p>
A few years ago, a problem arose in some of my work that I wasnâ€™t able to solve, forcing me to add a technical hypothesis to a theorem - this has bothered me ever since. The issue has to do with the relationship between independence in a stable (or simple or NSOP_1) theory and independence in a stable reduct. In this rather informal talk, I will describe the problem and some partial results. The audience is welcome to provide proofs or counterexamples.
