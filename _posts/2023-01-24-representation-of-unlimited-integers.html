<p>
Nonstandard methods have been successfully applied to standard problems in number theory by R. Jin, T. Tao and others.   A. Boudaoud and D. Bellaouar are pursuing the opposite direction: they are formulating number-theoretic problems in the language of nonstandard analysis and solving them by standard methods.  Two examples of the kind of questions they consider are:<br>
(1)  Can every unlimited natural number  n  be represented in the form  n  =  s + w_1w_2  where  s  is a limited integer and  w_1,  w_2  are unlimited?<br>
(2)  Can every unlimited natural number n  be represented in the form  n  =  w_1w_2 + w_3w_4  so that each ratio  w_i / w_j  is appreciable (ie, neither infinitesimal nor unlimited)?<br>
I give a negative answer to question (1) (assuming Dickson’s Conjecture) and a positive answer to question (2).<br>
