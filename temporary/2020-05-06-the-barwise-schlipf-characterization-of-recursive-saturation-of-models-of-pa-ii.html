abstract: "<p>The subject of this two-part talk is a 1975 Barwise-Schlipf landmark paper, whose main theorem asserts that a nonstandard model M of PA is recursively saturated iff M has an expansion to a model of the subsystem $&#92;Delta^{1}_{1}-CA_0$ of second order arithmetic. The impression one gets from reading the Barwise-Schlipf paper is that the left-to-right direction of the theorem is deep since it relies on sophisticated techniques from admissible set theory, and that the other direction is fairly routine. </p> 

<p>As it turns out, the exact opposite is the case: the left-to-right direction of the Barwise-Schlipf theorem lends itself to a proof from first principles (as observed independently by Jonathan Stavi and Sol Feferman not long after the appearance of the Barwise-Schmerl paper); and moreover, as recently shown in my joint work with Jim Schmerl, there is a crucial error in the Barwise-Schlipf proof of the right-to-left direction of the theorem, an error that can be circumvented by a rather nontrivial argument. As I will explain, certain results from the joint work of Matt Kaufmann and Jim Schmerl in the mid-1980s on 'lofty' models of arithmetic come in handy for the analysis of the error, and for circumventing it.</p> 
<p>
In part I, after going over some history, and preliminaries, I will discuss (1) the gap in the Barwise-Schlipf paper, and (2) the aforementioned Feferman-Stavi proof. In part II, I will focus on how the gap can be circumvented with a proof strategy very different from that Barwise and Schlipf.​
