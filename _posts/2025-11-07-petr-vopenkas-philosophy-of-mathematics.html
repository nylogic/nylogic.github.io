<p>
Petr Vopěnka (1935-2015) was an influential mathematician and deep and original
thinker. In the 1970s, he and Petr Hájek developed a system  of  non-Cantorial set theory, wich
was first known the theory of semi-sets, and later became Alternative Set Theory (AST).
The primary new  concept on which  the axioms of AST are based is what Vopěnka called
natural infinity. In my talk I  will outline some of Vopenka's thoughts on foundations of
mathematics and the  role of set theory in it, followed by a discussion of the axioms of AST.
