Fundamental to the practice of logic is the dogma regarding the first order/second order logic distinction, namely that it is ironclad. Was it always so? The emergence of the set theoretic paradigm is an interesting test case. Early workers in foundations generally used higher order systems in the form of type theory; but then higher order systems were gradually abandoned in favour of first order set theoryâ€”a transition that was completed, more or less, by the 1930s. In this talk I will look at first order logic from various points of view, arguing that the distinction between first order and higher order logics, such as second order logic, is somewhat context dependent. From the philosophical or foundational point of view this complicates the picture of first order logic as a canonical logic.
