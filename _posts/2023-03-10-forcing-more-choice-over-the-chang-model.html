<p>
The ordinal $&#92;Theta$ has lots of interesting results in the context of $L(&#92;mathbb R)$.  Here, we try to find an analogue of $&#92;Theta$ for the Chang model, and see what assumptions about it are natural.  These assumptions come out of the process of forcing more dependent choice over the Chang model.
