abstract: "<p>
We will present the following striking theorem, due to Towsner: If $(M, &#92;mathcal X) &#92;models &#92;mathsf{RCA}_0 + I&#92;Sigma_n$ is countable, then for <em>any</em> (!!!) $W &#92;subseteq M$ there is a countable expansion with the same first order part, $(M, &#92;mathcal Y)$, where $&#92;mathcal X &#92;subseteq &#92;mathcal Y$ so that $(M, &#92;mathcal Y) &#92;models &#92;mathsf{RCA}_0 + I&#92;Sigma_n$ and the set $W$ is $&#92;Delta_{n+1}$ definable. Time permitting, we will then sketch some nice applications of this theorem to the study of conservative extensions of fragments of arithmetic.
