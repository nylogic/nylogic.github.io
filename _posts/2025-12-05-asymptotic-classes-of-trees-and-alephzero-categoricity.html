 In this talk we introduce a framework for analyzing $&#92;aleph_0$-categorical theories of trees using a combinatorial notion called a tree plan.  We show that every $&#92;aleph_0$-categorical theory of trees arises from a Fraïssé class $K$ determined by a tree plan, and that each  such $K$ forms an asymptotic class in the sense of  Macpherson--Steinhorn.  We then discuss the model-theoretic consequences of this perspective, including the behavior of ultraproducts, the emergence of  $&#92;aleph_0$-categoricity from asymptotic classes of finite trees, and a characterization of supersimple finite-rank theories of trees in terms of  their associated tree plans.
