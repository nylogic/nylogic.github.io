<p>
We say that a Turing degree is high in some context if it can always compute a correct answer given an input
for which this is possible. When no correct answer is possible, however, what might such a degree do?
We explore the possibilities in the context of computable structure theory. 

This is joint work with Wesley Calvert and Dan Turetsky.
