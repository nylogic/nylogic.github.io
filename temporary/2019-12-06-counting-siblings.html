abstract: "Two countable structures are siblings if each is embeddable into the other (e.g., any two countable non-scattered linear orders are siblings). Clearly if M and N are siblings, they have the same finite substructures, hence have the same universal theories.  We characterize the universal theories in a finite, relational language that have a countable model with $2^{&#92;aleph_0}$ siblings.  This is joint work with Sam Braunfeld."
