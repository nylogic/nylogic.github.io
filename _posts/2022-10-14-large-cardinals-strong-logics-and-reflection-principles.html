abstract: "
<p>Various results establish deep connections between the existence of large cardinals, regularity properties of strong logics and the validity of set-theoretic reflection principles. In particular, several compactness properties of strong logics were proven to be equivalent to  large cardinal axioms. An important example of such an equivalence is given by a theorem of Makowsky that shows that <em>Vopěnka's Principle</em> is equivalent to the existence of strong compactness cardinals for all abstract logics. Motivated by  work of Boney, Dimopoulos, Gitman and Magidor, I recently proved an analogous combinatorial characterization of the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics that is closely connected to the notion of <em>subtle cardinals</em>, introduced by Kunen and Jensen in their studies of strong diamond principles, and the concept of <em>shrewd cardinals</em>, defined by Rathjen in proof-theoretic work. In my talk, I want to first discuss the details of this characterization and then present connections to recent joint work with Joan Bagaria (Barcelona) on recurring patterns in the large cardinal hierarchy.</p>
