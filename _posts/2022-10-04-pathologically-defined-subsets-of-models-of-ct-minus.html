It is well known that every countable recursively saturated model of $&#92;mathsf{PA}$ has a full compositional truth predicate; that is, such a model is expandable to the theory $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$. It is also well known that such a truth predicate need not be inductive, or indeed, need not satisfy even $&#92;Delta_0$ induction. Recently, Enayat and Pakhomov showed that $&#92;Delta_0$ induction for the truth predicate is equivalent to the principle of disjunctive correctness: the assertion that for any sequence of sentences $&#92;langle &#92;phi_i : i &#92;lt c &#92;rangle$, the disjunction $&#92;bigvee&#92;limits_{i &#92;lt c} &#92;phi_i$ is evaluated as true if and only if there is $i &#92;lt c$ such that $&#92;phi_i$ is evaluated as true. In the absence of $&#92;Delta_0$ induction, various pathologies can occur, including models of $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$ for which all nonstandard length disjunctions are evaluated as true. In this talk, we classify the sets X for which there is a model of $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$ in which X is exactly the set of those c such that the disjunctions of length c of 0 = 1 is evaluated as false. In particular, we see that X can be $&#92;omega$ if and only if $&#92;omega$ is a strong cut, and therefore the 'disjunctively trivial' models mentioned before are in fact arithmetically saturated. This is joint work (in progress) with Mateusz Łełyk.
