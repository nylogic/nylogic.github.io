Algebraic relations between solutions of Poizat equations.
Abstract:  In my Logic Workshop talk I showed that for rational functions $f(x)$ over the constants,
the differential equations $x^{&#92;prime&#92;prime}/x^&#92;prime=f(x)$ is strongly minimal if and only
if $f$ has no antiderivative in the rational functions.  In this talk I will fully characterize orthogonality and
algebraic relations between solutions to one, or more, equations of this type.
This is joint work with Freitag, Jaoui and Nagloo.  Although this is an extension of an earlier talk,
I will try to make it self contained.
