abstract: "<p>
We will continue discussing Shelah's technique of $(&#92;mathcal L, n)$ models and their applications to independence results in PA. This includes a new proof of Paris-Harrington and an example of a concrete true but unprovable $&#92;Pi^0_1$ sentence. Time permitting we'll also discuss the connection of these ideas to Wilkie's theorem on Why PA? and Kripke's notion of fulfillment.
