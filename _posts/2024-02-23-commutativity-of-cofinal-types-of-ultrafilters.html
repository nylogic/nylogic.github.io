The Tukey order finds its origins in the concept of Moore-Smith convergence
in topology, and is especially important when restricted to ultrafilters with
reverse inclusion. The Tukey order of ultrafilters over $&#92;omega$ was studied intensively by
Blass, Dobrinen, Isbell, Raghavan, Shelah, Todorcevic and many others, but still
contains many fundamental unresolved problems. After reviewing the topological
background for the Tukey order, I will present a recent development in the theory of
the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters on measurable cardinals, and explain how
different the situation is when compared to ultrafilters on $&#92;omega$. Moreover, we will see
an important application to the Galvin property of ultrafilters. In the second part
of the talk, we will demonstrate how ideas and intuition from ultrafilters over measurable
cardinals lead to new results on the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters
over $&#92;omega$. This is joint with Natasha Dobrinen.
