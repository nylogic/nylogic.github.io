<p>
Classically, an object is ordinal definable if it is the unique one satisfying a formula with ordinal parameters. Generalizing this concept, given a cardinal $&#92;kappa$, I call an object $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable if it belongs to an ordinal definable set with fewer than $&#92;kappa$ elements (called a $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurry definition). By considering the hereditary versions of this notion, one arrives at a hierarchy of inner models, indexed by cardinals $&#92;kappa$: the collection of all hereditarily $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable sets, which I call $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-HOD. In a ZFC-model, this hierarchy spans the entire spectrum from HOD to V. 
</p>
<p>
The special cases $&#92;kappa=&#92;omega$ and $&#92;kappa=&#92;omega_1$ have been previously considered, but no systematic study of the general setting has been carried out, it seems. One main aspect of the analysis is the notion of a leap, that is, a cardinal at which a new object becomes hereditarily blurrily definable. </p>
<p>
In this talk, I will focus on the ZFC-provable structural properties of the blurry HOD hierarchy, which turn out to be surprisingly plentiful. So for the most part, the talk will be forcing-free. Time permitting, I may hint at the result of the equiconsistency between the least leap being the successor of a singular strong limit cardinal and the existence of a measurable cardinal, for which, admittedly, forcing is used in one direction.
