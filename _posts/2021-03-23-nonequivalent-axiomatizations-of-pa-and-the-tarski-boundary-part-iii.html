abstract: "
<p>This is a continuation of the talk from Feb 16th. This time we shall study different theories of the form ${&#92;rm CT}^-[&#92;delta]$ which are conservative extensions of a ${&#92;rm PA}$. In particular, we prove the following theorem.</p>
<p>
<strong>Theorem 2</strong> There exists a family $&#92;{&#92;delta_f&#92;}_{f&#92;in&#92;omega^*}$ such that  for all $f,g&#92;in&#92;omega^*$</br>
1)  ${&#92;rm CT}^-[&#92;delta_f]$ is conservative over ${&#92;rm PA}$;</br>
2) if $f&#92;subsetneq g$, then ${&#92;rm CT}^-[&#92;delta_g]$ properly extends ${&#92;rm CT}^-[&#92;delta_f]$;</br>
3) if $f&#92;perp g$ then ${&#92;rm CT}^-[&#92;delta_g]&#92;cup {&#92;rm CT}^-[&#92;delta_f]$ is nonconservative over ${&#92;rm PA}$ (but consistent).
</p>
<p>We will finish the proof of the theorem announced in the abstract of part II.</p>
