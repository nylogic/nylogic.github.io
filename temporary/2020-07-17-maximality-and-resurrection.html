abstract: "
<p>
The maximality principle (${&#92;rm MP}$) is the assertion that any sentence which can be forced in such a way that after any further forcing the sentence remains true, must already be true. In modal terms, ${&#92;rm MP}$ states that forceably necessary sentences are true. The resurrection axiom (${&#92;rm RA}$) asserts that the ground model is as existentially closed in its forcing extensions as possible. In particular, ${&#92;rm RA}$ relative to $H_{&#92;mathfrak c}$ states that for every forcing $&#92;mathbb Q$ there is a further forcing $&#92;mathbb R$ such that $H_{&#92;mathfrak c}^V &#92;prec H_{&#92;mathfrak c}^{V[G][H]}$, for $G*H &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb Q *&#92;dot{&#92;mathbb R}$ generic.

<p>
It is reasonable to ask whether ${&#92;rm MP}$ and ${&#92;rm RA}$ can consistently both hold. I showed that indeed they can, and that ${&#92;rm RA}+{&#92;rm MP}$ is equiconsistent with a strongly uplifting fully reflecting cardinal, which is a combination of the large cardinals used to force the principles separately. In this talk I give a sketch of the equiconsistency result.</p>
