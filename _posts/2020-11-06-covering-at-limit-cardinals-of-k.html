<p>
Theorem (Mitchell and Schimmerling, submitted for publication) Assume
there is no transitive class model of ZFC with a Woodin cardinal. Let
$&#92;nu$ be a singular ordinal such that $&#92;nu > &#92;omega_2$ and
$&#92;mathrm{cf}(&#92;nu) < | &#92;nu |$. Suppose $&#92;nu$ is a regular cardinal in K.
Then $&#92;nu$ is a measurable cardinal in K. Moreover, if $&#92;mathrm{cf}(&#92;nu) >
&#92;omega$, then $o^&#92;mathrm{K}(&#92;nu) &#92;ge &#92;mathrm{cf}(&#92;nu)$.</p>
<p>
I will say something intuitive and wildly incomplete but not misleading
about the meaning of the theorem, how it is proved, and the history of
results behind it.</p>
