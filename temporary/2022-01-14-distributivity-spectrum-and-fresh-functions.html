<p>
We discuss different notions of a distributivity spectrum of forcings. 
</p><p>
In the first talk, I will mainly focus on the notion of fresh functions and the corresponding spectrum. A function with
domain lambda is fresh if it is new but all its initial segments are in the ground model. I will give general facts how to
compute the fresh function spectrum, also discussing what sets are realizable as a fresh function spectrum of a forcing.
Moreover, I will provide several examples, including well-known tree forcings on omega such as Sacks and Mathias forcing, as well as Prikry and Namba forcing to illustrate the difference between fresh functions and fresh subsets. 
 </p><p>
In the second talk, I will also discuss another ('combinatorial') distributivity spectrum; most importantly, analyzing this notion for the forcing P(omega)/fin.

This is joint work with Vera Fischer and Marlene Koelbing.
