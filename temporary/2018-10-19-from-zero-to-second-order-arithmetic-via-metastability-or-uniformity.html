abstract: "<p>
Taoâ€™s metastability, going back to Kreisel and Goedel, is a notion of convergence 
with nice computational properties. The trade-off involved in metastability is that one obtains 
uniform and effective information, but only about a finite (but arbitrarily large) domain. We 
apply this metastability trade-off, i.e. introducing finite domains to yield uniform and effective
results, to concepts other than convergence.  This results in theorems requiring full second
order arithmetic for a proof.  We obtain similar results for another notion inspired by proof 
theory, namely uniform theorems, in which the objects claimed to exist depend on few of the
parameters in the theorem.
