abstract: "
<p>
Parameters are free variables in various axiom schemata in PA, ZFC, and other similar theories. Given an axiom schema S, we let S* be the parameter-free sub-schema.</p>
<p>
Kreisel (A survey of proof theory, JSL 1968) was one of those who paid attention to the comparison of some schemata in second-order PA and their parameter-free versions. In particular, Kreisel noted that<br>

[...] if one is convinced of the significance of something like a given axiom schema, it is natural to study details, such as the effect of parameters.</p> 
<p>
This talk is devoted to the effect of parameters in the schemata of Comprehension and Choice in second-order arithmetic.
