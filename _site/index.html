							 <p> For a cardinal $&#92;kappa&#92;ge 2$, one can weaken the concept 'x is ordinal definable' (i.e., x is the unique object satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters) to 'x is $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable,' meaning that x is one of fewer than $&#92;kappa$ many objects satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters. By considering the hereditary version of this, one naturally arrives at the inner model $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-HOD, the class of all hereditarily $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable sets. In ZFC, by varying $&#92;kappa$, one obtains a hierarchy of inner models spanning all the way from HOD to V. The leaps are those stages in the hierarchy where something new is added. I have previously given a logic workshop talk about the basic theory of the blurry HOD hierarchy, and in this talk, after reviewing the basics, I want to focus on the consistency strengths of certain leap constellations, ranging from outright consistent, to equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal, to inconsistent. </p>

							 <p> Mutual stationarity is a compactness type property for singular cardinals. Roughly, it asserts that given a singular cardinal $&#92;kappa$, stationary subsets of regular cardinals with limit $&#92;kappa$ have a 'simultaneous witness' for their stationarity. This principle was first defined by Foreman and Magidor in 2001, who showed that it holds when the stationary sets are of points of countable cofinality. They also showed that in general this does not generalize to higher cofinality. Whether the principle can consistently hold for higher cofinalities remained open, until a few years ago Ben Neria showed that from large cardinals mutual stationarity at $&#92;langle&#92;aleph_n&#92;mid n&#92;lt&#92;omega&#92;rangle$ can be forced for any fixed cofinality. </p><p> We show that we can obtain mutual stationarity at $&#92;langle&#92;aleph_n&#92;mid n&#92;lt&#92;omega&#92;rangle$ for any fixed cofinality together with the failure of SCH at $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$. Along the way we reduce the Ben Neria's large cardinal hypothesis. This is joint work with Will Adkisson. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix83QG4rmIw'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> The algebraic field extensions of the rational numbers $&#92;mathbb{Q}$ – equivalently, the subfields of the algebraic closure $&#92;overline{&#92;mathbb{Q}}$ – naturally form a topological space homeomorphic to Cantor space.  Consequently, one can speak of 'large' collections of such fields, in the sense of Baire category&#58; collections that are comeager in the space.  Under a standard definition, the <em>1-generic fields</em> form a comeager set in this space.  Therefore, one may think of a property common to all 1-generic fields as a property that one might reasonably expect to be true of an arbitrarily chosen algebraic field. </p><p> We will present joint work with Eisenträger, Springer, and Westrick that proves several intriguing properties to be true of all 1-generic fields $F$.  First, in every such $F$, both the subring $&#92;mathbb{Z}$ of the integers and the subring $&#92;mathcal{O}_F$ of the algebraic integers of $F$ cannot be defined within $F$ by an existential formula, nor by a universal formula.  (Subsequent work by Dittman and Fehm has shown that in fact these subrings are completely undefinable in these fields.)  Next, for every presentation of every such $F$, the <em>root set</em></p> <p align='center'> $ R_F = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X]:p(X)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F&#92;} $ </p><p> is always of low Turing degree relative to that presentation, but is essentially always undecidable relative to the presentation.  Moreover, the set known as <em>Hilbert's Tenth Problem for $F$</em>,</p> <p align='center'> $ HTP(F) = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(X_1,&#92;ldots,X_n)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F^n&#92;}, $</p> <p> is exactly as difficult as $R_F$, which is its restriction to single-variable polynomials.  Finally, even the question of having infinitely many solutions,</p><p> $&#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(&#92;vec{X})=0&#92;text{ has infinitely many solutions in }F^n&#92;}, $</p> <p> is only as difficult as $R_F$.  These results are proven by using a forcing notion on the fields and showing that it is decidable whether or not a given condition forces a given polynomial to have a root, or to have infinitely many roots.</p>

							 <p> The Borel hierarchy gives a robust way to stratify the complexity of sets of countable structures and is intimately tied with definability in infinitary logic via the Lopez-Escobar theorem. However, what happens with sets axiomatizable in finitary first-order logic, such as the set of structures satisfying a given finitary first-order theory T? Is the complexity of the set of T's models in any way related to the quantifier complexity of the sentences axiomatizing it? In particular, if a theory T is not axiomatizable by a set of sentences of bounded quantifier complexity, can the set of models of T still be at a finite level of the Borel hierarchy? </p><p> In this talk, we will present results concerning these questions&#58; </p><p> In joint work with Andrews, Gonzalez, Lempp, and Zhu we show that the set of models of a theory T is $&#92;Pi^0_&#92;omega$-complete if and only if T does not have an axiomatization by sentences of bounded quantifier complexity, answering the last question in the negative. We also characterize the Borel complexity of the set of models of complete theories in terms of their finitary axiomatizations. Our results suggest that infinitary logic does not provide any efficacy when defining first-order properties, a phenomenon already observed by Wadge and Keisler and, recently, rediscovered by Harrison-Trainor and Kretschmer using different techniques. </p><p> Combining our results with recent results by Enayat and Visser, we obtain that a large class of theories studied in the foundations of mathematics, sequential theories, have a maximal complicated set of models. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akL5zUz1Jz4'>Video</a></strong></p> ​

<p> Finite Ramsey Theorem states that fixed $n,m,k &#92;in &#92;mathbb N$, there exists $N &#92;in &#92;mathbb N$ such that for each coloring of $[N]^n$ with $k$ colors, there is a homogeneous subset $H$ of $N$ of cardinality at least $m$. Starting with the celebrated Paris-Harrington theorem, many Ramsey-like results have been studied using different largeness notions rather than the cardinality. I will introduce the largeness notion defined by Ketonen and Solovay based on fundamental sequences of ordinals. Then I will describe an alternative and more flexible largeness notion using blocks and barriers. If time allows, I will talk about how the latter can be used to study a more general Ramsey-like result. </p>

							 <p> In their 1979 paper `Minimal Infinite Topological Spaces,’ Ginsburg and Sands proved that every infinite topological space has an infinite subspace homeomorphic to exactly one of the following five topologies on $&#92;omega$&#58; indiscrete, discrete, initial segment, final segment, and cofinite. The proof, while nonconstructive, features an interesting application of Ramsey's theorem for pairs ($&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$). We analyze this principle in computability theory and reverse mathematics, using Dorais's formalization of CSC spaces. Among our results are that the Ginsburg-Sands theorem for CSC spaces is equivalent to $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0,$ while for Hausdorff spaces it is provable in $&#92;mathsf{RCA}_0$. Furthermore, if we enrich a CSC space by adding the closure operator on points, then the Ginsburg-Sands theorem turns out to be equivalent to the Chain-Antichain Principle ($&#92;mathsf{CAC}$). The most surprising case is that of the Ginsburg-Sands theorem restricted to $T_1$ spaces. Here, we show that the principle lies strictly between $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$, yielding perhaps the first natural theorem of ordinary mathematics (i.e., conceived outside of logic) to occupy this interval. I will discuss the proofs of both the implications and separations, which feature several novel combinatorial elements, and survey a new class of purely combinatorial principles below $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and not implied by $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$ revealed by our investigation. This is joint work with Heidi Benham, Andrew DeLapo, Reed Solomon, and Java Darleen Villano. </p>

The Tukey order of ultrafilters over $&#92;omega$ was studied intensively by Blass, Dobrinen, Isbell, Raghavan, Shelah, Todorcevic and many others, but still contains many fundamental unresolved problems. After reviewing the topological background for the Tukey order, I will present a recent development in the theory of the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters on measurable cardinals, and explain how different the situation is when compared to ultrafilters on $&#92;omega$. Moreover, we will see an important application to the Galvin property of ultrafilters. In the second part of the talk, we will demonstrate how ideas and intuition from ultrafilters over measurable cardinals lead to new results on the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters over $&#92;omega$. This is joint with Natasha Dobrinen. </p>

							 <p> It is well-known under ZFC that there is a nonstandard model of PA which has a full standard system, i.e. every subset of this model's standard cut is the intersection of the standard cut with some subset of the model which is definable from parameters. We show that the use of Choice here cannot be avoided. More precisely, we prove that it is consistent relative to ZF that no model of PA has full standard system, and it is provable in ZF (or just a fragment of second-order arithmetic) that no Borel model has full standard system. The proof is measure-theoretic in nature, and as a simpler first argument, we will prove from Projective Determinacy the stronger claim that no projective model has full standard system.</p> <p>Since the power set of the naturals is trivially a Scott set, an immediate corollary of this result is that Scott's problem is independent of ZF.</p> <p><strong><a href='/files/GlazerSlides022024.pdf'>Slides</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvrEyqh1hUk'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> A structure, R,  expanding $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt)$ is called component closed if whenever $X &#92;subseteq R^n$ is definable so are all of $X$'s connected components.   Two basic examples of component closed structures are $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt, +, &#92;cdot)$ and $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt, &#92;cdot, &#92;mathbb{Z})$.  It turns out that these two structures are exemplary of a general phenomenon for component closed structures from a broad class of expansions of $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt)$:  either their definable sets are very 'tame' (as in the case of the real closed field) or they are quite 'wild' (as in the case of the real field expanded by the integers).

							 <p> It was shown by Visser that Peano Arithmetic has the property that no two distinct extensions of it (in its language) are bi-interpretable. Enayat proposed to refer to this property of a theory as <em>tightness</em> and to carry out a more systematic study of tightness and its stronger variants, which he called <em>neatness</em> and <em>solidity</em>. </p><p> Enayat proved that not only $&#92;text{PA}$, but also $&#92;text{ZF}$, $&#92;text{Z}_{2}$, and $&#92;text{KM}$ are solid; and on the other hand, that finitely axiomatisable fragments of them are not even tight. Later work by a number of authors showed that many natural proper fragments of these theories are also not tight. </p><p> Enayat asked whether there are proper solid subtheories (containing some basic axioms that depend on the theory) of the theories listed above. We answer this question in the case of $&#92;text{PA}$ by proving that for every $n$ there exists a solid theory strictly between $&#92;text{I}&#92;Sigma_{n}$ and $&#92;text{PA}$. Furthermore, we can require that the theory does not interpret $&#92;text{PA}$, and that if any true arithmetic sentence is added to it, the theory still does not prove $&#92;text{PA}$. </p><p> Joint work with Leszek Kołodziejczyk and Mateusz Łełyk. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHHznrImG4M'>Video</a></strong></p> ​

							 <p> We consider logics in which the collection of sentences over a set-sized vocabulary can form a proper class. The easiest example of such a logic is $&#92;mathcal L_{&#92;infty &#92;infty}$,  which allows for disjunctions and conjunctions over arbitrarily sized sets of formulas and quantification over strings of variables of any infinite length. Model theory of $&#92;mathcal L_{&#92;infty &#92;infty}$ is very restricted. For instance, it is inconsistent for it to have nice compactness or Löwenheim-Skolem properties. However, Trevor Wilson recently showed that the existence of a Löwenheim-Skolem-Tarski number of a certain class-sized fragment of $&#92;mathcal L_{&#92;infty &#92;infty}$ is equivalent to the existence of a supercompact cardinal, and various other related results. We continue this work by considering several appropriate class-sized logics and their relations to large cardinals.

							 <p> A uniform ultrafilter $U$ over a cardinal $&#92;kappa > &#92;omega_1$ is called <em>indecomposable</em> if, whenever $&#92;lambda &#92;lt&#92;kappa$ and $f:&#92;kappa &#92;rightarrow &#92;lambda$, there is a set $X &#92;in U$ such that $f[X]$ is countable. Indecomposability is a natural weakening of $&#92;kappa$-completeness and has a number of implications for, e.g., the structure of ultraproducts. In the 1980s, Sheard answered a question of Silver by proving the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible but not weakly compact cardinal carrying an indecomposable ultrafilter. Recently, however, Goldberg proved that this situation cannot hold above a strongly compact cardinal&#58; If $&#92;lambda$ is strongly compact and $&#92;kappa &#92;geq &#92;lambda$ carries an indecomposable ultrafilter, then $&#92;kappa$ is either measurable or a singular limit of countably many measurable cardinals. We prove that the same conclusion follows from the Proper Forcing Axiom, thus adding to the long list of statements first shown to hold above a strongly compact or supercompact cardinal and later shown also to follow from PFA. Time permitting, we will employ certain indexed square principles to prove that our results are sharp.

							 <p> A computable quotient presentation of a mathematical structure $&#92;mathcal A$ consists of a computable structure on the natural numbers $&#92;langle &#92;mathbb{N},&#92;star,&#92;ast,&#92;dots &#92;rangle$, meaning that the operations and relations of the structure are computable, and an equivalence relation $E$ on $&#92;mathbb{N}$, not necessarily computable but which is a congruence with respect to this structure, such that the quotient  $&#92;langle &#92;mathbb{N},&#92;star,&#92;ast,&#92;dots &#92;rangle$  is isomorphic to the given structure $&#92;mathcal{A}$. Thus, one may consider computable quotient presentations of graphs, groups, orders, rings and so on.</br> A natural question asked by B. Khoussainov in 2016, is if the Tennenbaum Thoerem extends to the context of computable presentations of nonstandard models of arithmetic. In a joint work with J.D. Hamkins we have proved that no nonstandard model of arithmetic admits a computable quotient presentation by a computably enumerable equivalence relation on the natural numbers.</br> However, as it happens, there exists a nonstandard model of arithmetic admitting a computable quotient presentation by a co-c.e. equivalence relation. Actually, there are infinitely many of those. The idea of the proof consists is simulating the Henkin construction via finite injury priority argument. What is quite surprising, the construction works (i.e. injury lemma holds) by Hilbert's Basis Theorem. The latter argument is joint work with T. Slaman and L. Harrington. </p>

							 <p> In the late 1910s Bertrand Russell was occupied with two things: getting into political trouble for his pacifism and trying to understand the foundations of mathematics. His students were hard at work with him on this second occupation. One of those students was Dorothy Wrinch. In 1923 she gave a characterization of the axiom of choice in terms of a generalization of the notion of a Dedekind-finite infinite set. Unfortunately, her career turned toward mathematical biology and her logical work was forgotten by history. </p><p> This talk is part of a project of revisiting Wrinch's work from a modern perspective. I will present the main result of her 1923 paper, that AC is equivalent to the non-existence of what she termed mediate cardinals. I will also talk about some new independence results. The two main results are: (1) the smallest $&#92;kappa$ for which a $&#92;kappa$-mediate cardinal exists can consistently be any regular $&#92;kappa$ and (2) the collection of regular $&#92;kappa$ for which exact $&#92;kappa$-mediate cardinals exist can consistently be any class. </p>

<p> In 1911, Dehn proposed three decision problems for finitely presented groups&#58; the word problem, the conjugacy problem, and the isomorphism problem. These problems have been central to both group theory and logic, and were each proven to be undecidable in the 50's. There is much current research studying the decidability of these problems in certain classes of groups. </p> <p> Classically, when a decision problem is undecidable, its complexity is measured using Turing reducibility. However, Dehn's problems can also be naturally thought of as computably enumerable equivalence relations (ceers). We take this point of view and measure their complexity using computable reductions. This yields behaviors different from the classical context&#58; for instance, every Turing degree contains a word problem, but not every ceer degree does. This leads us to study the structure of ceer degrees containing a word problem and other related questions. </p>

							 <p> In the late 1910s Bertrand Russell was occupied with two things: getting into political trouble for his pacifism and trying to understand the foundations of mathematics. His students were hard at work with him on this second occupation. One of those students was Dorothy Wrinch. In 1923 she gave a characterization of the axiom of choice in terms of a generalization of the notion of a Dedekind-finite infinite set. Unfortunately, her career turned toward mathematical biology and her logical work was forgotten by history. </p><p> This talk is part of a project of revisiting Wrinch's work from a modern perspective. I will present the main result of her 1923 paper, that AC is equivalent to the non-existence of what she termed mediate cardinals. I will also talk about some new independence results. The two main results are: (1) the smallest $&#92;kappa$ for which a $&#92;kappa$-mediate cardinal exists can consistently be any regular $&#92;kappa$ and (2) the collection of regular $&#92;kappa$ for which exact $&#92;kappa$-mediate cardinals exist can consistently be any class. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

This approach yields the definability of the existential theory of $F_p[[t]]$ (in the ring language with a constant for $t$) contingent upon the validity of resolution of singularities (Denef-Schoutens).

							 <p> (This is a joint work with Keita Yokoyama) Some recent studies in reverse mathematics focus on theorems that are stronger than $&#92;mathsf{ATR}_0$ and weaker than $&#92;Pi^1_1$-$&#92;mathsf{CA}_0$. Especially, theorems represented by a $&#92;Pi^1_2$ sentence and provable from $&#92;Pi^1_1$-$&#92;mathsf{CA}_0$ are investigated. In this talk, we will introduce a hierarchy slicing the set $&#92;{&#92;sigma &#92;in &#92;Pi^1_2: &#92;Pi^1_1&#92;text{-}&#92;mathsf{CA}_0&#92;}$. Then, we show that Ramsey's theorem for $&#92;Sigma^0_2,&#92;Sigma^0_3,&#92;Sigma^0_4,&#92;ldots$ sets are separated in a sense although all of them are equivalent to $&#92;Pi^1_1$-$&#92;mathsf{CA}_0$ by comparing this hierarchy and a suitable weaker variant of those theorems. We also show that a similar result holds for $(&#92;Sigma^0_1)_n$ determinacy. </p> <p><strong><a href='/files/SuzukiSlides042024.pdf'>Slides</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awnSj_30a-8'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> In this talk we discuss the computability of the entropy $H_{&#92;rm top}(X)$ and topological pressure $P_{&#92;rm top}(&#92;phi)$ on compact shift spaces $X$ and continuous potentials $&#92;phi&#58;X&#92;to&#92;mathbb R$. This question has recently been studied for subshifts of finite type (SFTs) and their factors (Sofic shifts). We develop a framework to address the computability of the entropy pressure on general shift spaces and apply this framework to coded shifts. In particular, we prove the computability of the topological pressure for all continuous potentials on S-gap shifts, generalized gap shifts, and Beta shifts. We also construct shift spaces which, depending on the potential, exhibit computability and non-computability of the topological pressure. We further show that the generalized pressure function $(X,&#92;phi)&#92;mapsto P_{&#92;rm top}(X,&#92;phi&#92;vert_{X})$ is not computable for a large set of shift spaces $X$ and potentials $&#92;phi$. Along the way of developing these computability results, we derive several ergodic-theoretical properties of coded shifts which are of independent interest beyond the realm of computability. The topic of the talk is joint work with Michael Burr (Clemson U.), Shuddho Das (Texas Tech) and Yun Yang (Virginia Tech). </p>

							 <p> In this talk, I plan to explore a few notions of 'genericity' in the context of models of arithmetic. I will recall the notion of genericity borrowed from set-theory, used by Simpson to prove that every countable model of PA has an expansion to a pointwise definable model of PA*. I will then explore other notions of genericity inspired by more model-theoretic contexts. One such notion is 'neutrality'&#58; in a model M, we say an undefinable set X is neutral if the definable closure relation in (M, X) is the same as in M. Another notion, inspired by work done on model-theoretic genericity by Chatzidakis and Pillay, is called CP-genericity. I will explore these notions and outline some results, including&#58; (1) every model of PA has a neutral set which is not CP-generic, (2) every countable model of PA has a CP-generic which is not neutral (and in fact, fails neutrality spectacularly&#58; ie, we can find a CP-generic where the expansion is pointwise definable), and (3) every countable model of PA has a neutral CP-generic. This talk touches on work contained in two papers, one of which was joint work with Roman Kossak, and the other was joint work with James Schmerl. </p>

							 <p> Tarski's undefinability of truth theorem has two versions, the first one deals with truth itself, takes some effort to prove, and is a descendant of the Epimenides (liar) paradox. The second one deals with the related concept of satisfaction, has a one-line proof, and is a descendent of Russell's paradox. This talk is about the first one, which appeared in the 1953 monograph 'Undecidable Theories' by Tarski, Mostowski, and Robinson; it was employed there to show the essential undecidability of consistent theories that can represent all recursive functions (a strong form of the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem). I will present Tarski's original 1953 formulation (which differs from the common formulation in modern expositions) and will explain how it was used in my recent work with Albert Visser to show that no consistent completion of a sequential theory whose signature is finite is axiomatizable by a collection of sentences of bounded quantifier-alternation-depth.  A variant of this result was proved independently by Emil Jeřábek, as I will explain. Our proof method has a pedagogical dividend since it allows one to replace the cryptic Gödel-Carnap fixed point lemma with the perspicuous undefinability of truth theorem in the proof of the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>
