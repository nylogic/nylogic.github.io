abstract: "This is based on joint work with David Evans, Jan Hubička and
Jaroslav Nešetřil. The extension property for partial automorphisms
(EPPA), also called the Hrushovski property is a property of classes of
finite structures stating that for every A there is B containing A as a
substructure such that every isomorphism of substructures of A extends
to an automorphism of B. Every class with EPPA is an amalgamation class,
in fact, EPPA is equivalent to some properties of the automorphism group
of the Fraisse limit of the class. In particular, EPPA is a key
ingredient in proving ample generics, the small index property etc. In
this talk, we show a new easy way of proving EPPA for the class of all
finite graphs and then explain how to extend these techniques to get
EPPA for two-graph and also the strongest sufficient condition for EPPA
so far. This talk should be self-contained."
