The Mid-Atlantic Mathematical Logic Seminar is an ongoing program of grass-roots meetings in mathematical logic in the northeastern United States. It is funded by grant #DMS-2508533 from the National Science Foundation, which provides travel support for speakers, students, and researchers without other means of support, so that they can attend MAMLS meetings. The co-Principal Investigator for this grant are Profs. Filippo Calderoni and Dima Sinapova, of Rutgers University, and Prof. Russell Miller of Queens College and the CUNY Graduate Center.  The grant is administered by Rutgers. For many years, Prof. Arthur Apter was the mainstay of the MAMLS grant, and we salute his efforts through those years. 
</p>

<p>
The meetings funded by MAMLS include several recurring conference series: the Groups, Logic, and Dynamics meeting (<a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~fc327/GLaDF2023/index.html">GLaD</a>), the New England Recursion and Definability Seminar (<a href="https://nerds.math.uconn.edu/">NERDS</a>), the NorthEast Model Theory Day (NEMTD), and the annual Rutgers Logic Meeting. In addition, wild-card MAMLS meetings take place intermittently. Students and others who wish to apply for MAMLS funding to attend one of these meetings should initiate the process by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:calderonifilippo@gmail.com">Filippo Calderoni</a>.

</p>


<h2><strong>MAMLS Meetings</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~fc327/MAMLS2024/index.html">Rutgers MAMLS Fall Fest 2025</a></strong></h3>
<p>
The annual MAMLS meeting at Rutgers University will take place on September 26-28, 2025, in downtown New Brunswick, NJ, beginning at 3:30 pm Friday and ending at 12:30 pm Sunday, organized by Filippo Calderoni and Dima Sinapova.  The invited speakers are Tom Benhamou, Will Boney, Yutong Duan, James Freitag, Victoria Gitman, Ted Slaman, Henry Towsner, Anush Tserunyan, and James Walsh.  Full information is available <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~fc327/MAMLS2025/index.html">here</a>, and everyone who plans to attend is requested to register at that site.  (There is no registration fee, but the organizers need to know how many attendees to expect.)

</p>
<h3><strong><a href="https://nerds.math.uconn.edu/">NERDS</a></strong></h3>
<p>
The New England Recursion and Definability Seminar meets twice a year, with a focus on computability theory, broadly interpreted. Meetings are open to all interested scholars in the region, regardless of your background or level in logic, and we encourage everyone connected with logic and computability to attend, learn something new, and make some logician friends. Some travel funding is available, thanks to the NSF grant supporting MAMLS. Anyone who is interested in attending and needs support for travel to NERDS should contact <a href="mailto:russell.miller@qc.cuny.edu">Russell Miller</a>. The next NERDS meeting will take place on Sunday, October 5, 2025, hosted by the University of Connecticut in Storrs, CT.  Further details will be available on the <a href="https://nerds.math.uconn.edu/">NERDS website</a>.

</p>

<h3><strong>GLaD</strong></h3>
<p>

The main goal of the annual meeting series "Groups, Logic and Dynamics" is to bring together people from different areas of math with common interest in groups and their actions, and to build a community around them. The scope of the meeting is very broad. It includes descriptive set theory, dynamics, geometric and measured group theory. GLaD is open to all interested scholars in the region. Students and early career researchers are particularly encouraged to participate. Anyone who is interested in attending and needs support for travel to GLaD should contact <a href="mailto:filippo.calderoni@rutgers.edu">Filippo Calderoni</a>. The next GLaD meeting is planned for the spring of 2026. The website for the most recent meeting is still available <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~fc327/GLaDS2025/index.html">here</a>.

</p>


<h3><strong>NEMTD</strong></h3>
<p>
We are pleased that the NorthEast Model Theory Day has returned:  it has held meetings at Wesleyan University in Middletown, CT on Saturday May 4, 2024, and at Towson State University in Towson, MD on Saturday, April 11, 2025.  The meeting website is still available <a href="https://nemtd.wescreates.wesleyan.edu">here</a>.  We plan for it to meet again in Spring 2026, bringing together those interested in model theory from across the region.
