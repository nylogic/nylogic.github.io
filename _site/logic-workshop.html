						<div style="display:none" id="0">
							 <p> For a cardinal $&#92;kappa&#92;ge 2$, one can weaken the concept 'x is ordinal definable' (i.e., x is the unique object satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters) to 'x is $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable,' meaning that x is one of fewer than $&#92;kappa$ many objects satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters. By considering the hereditary version of this, one naturally arrives at the inner model $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-HOD, the class of all hereditarily $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable sets. In ZFC, by varying $&#92;kappa$, one obtains a hierarchy of inner models spanning all the way from HOD to V. The leaps are those stages in the hierarchy where something new is added. I have previously given a logic workshop talk about the basic theory of the blurry HOD hierarchy, and in this talk, after reviewing the basics, I want to focus on the consistency strengths of certain leap constellations, ranging from outright consistent, to equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal, to inconsistent. </p>

						<div style="display:none" id="1">
							 <p> The algebraic field extensions of the rational numbers $&#92;mathbb{Q}$ – equivalently, the subfields of the algebraic closure $&#92;overline{&#92;mathbb{Q}}$ – naturally form a topological space homeomorphic to Cantor space.  Consequently, one can speak of 'large' collections of such fields, in the sense of Baire category&#58; collections that are comeager in the space.  Under a standard definition, the <em>1-generic fields</em> form a comeager set in this space.  Therefore, one may think of a property common to all 1-generic fields as a property that one might reasonably expect to be true of an arbitrarily chosen algebraic field. </p><p> We will present joint work with Eisenträger, Springer, and Westrick that proves several intriguing properties to be true of all 1-generic fields $F$.  First, in every such $F$, both the subring $&#92;mathbb{Z}$ of the integers and the subring $&#92;mathcal{O}_F$ of the algebraic integers of $F$ cannot be defined within $F$ by an existential formula, nor by a universal formula.  (Subsequent work by Dittman and Fehm has shown that in fact these subrings are completely undefinable in these fields.)  Next, for every presentation of every such $F$, the <em>root set</em></p> <p align='center'> $ R_F = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X]:p(X)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F&#92;} $ </p><p> is always of low Turing degree relative to that presentation, but is essentially always undecidable relative to the presentation.  Moreover, the set known as <em>Hilbert's Tenth Problem for $F$</em>,</p> <p align='center'> $ HTP(F) = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(X_1,&#92;ldots,X_n)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F^n&#92;}, $</p> <p> is exactly as difficult as $R_F$, which is its restriction to single-variable polynomials.  Finally, even the question of having infinitely many solutions,</p><p> $&#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(&#92;vec{X})=0&#92;text{ has infinitely many solutions in }F^n&#92;}, $</p> <p> is only as difficult as $R_F$.  These results are proven by using a forcing notion on the fields and showing that it is decidable whether or not a given condition forces a given polynomial to have a root, or to have infinitely many roots.</p>

			<strong><a data-toggle="collapse" href="javascript:toggle('2');">Abstract</a></strong>
						<div style="display:none" id="2">
							 <p> In their 1979 paper `Minimal Infinite Topological Spaces,’ Ginsburg and Sands proved that every infinite topological space has an infinite subspace homeomorphic to exactly one of the following five topologies on $&#92;omega$&#58; indiscrete, discrete, initial segment, final segment, and cofinite. The proof, while nonconstructive, features an interesting application of Ramsey's theorem for pairs ($&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$). We analyze this principle in computability theory and reverse mathematics, using Dorais's formalization of CSC spaces. Among our results are that the Ginsburg-Sands theorem for CSC spaces is equivalent to $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0,$ while for Hausdorff spaces it is provable in $&#92;mathsf{RCA}_0$. Furthermore, if we enrich a CSC space by adding the closure operator on points, then the Ginsburg-Sands theorem turns out to be equivalent to the Chain-Antichain Principle ($&#92;mathsf{CAC}$). The most surprising case is that of the Ginsburg-Sands theorem restricted to $T_1$ spaces. Here, we show that the principle lies strictly between $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$, yielding perhaps the first natural theorem of ordinary mathematics (i.e., conceived outside of logic) to occupy this interval. I will discuss the proofs of both the implications and separations, which feature several novel combinatorial elements, and survey a new class of purely combinatorial principles below $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and not implied by $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$ revealed by our investigation. This is joint work with Heidi Benham, Andrew DeLapo, Reed Solomon, and Java Darleen Villano. </p>

						<div style="display:none" id="3">
							 <p> The Tukey order finds its origins in the concept of Moore-Smith convergence in topology, and is especially important when restricted to ultrafilters with reverse inclusion. The Tukey order of ultrafilters over $&#92;omega$ was studied intensively by Blass, Dobrinen, Isbell, Raghavan, Shelah, Todorcevic and many others, but still contains many fundamental unresolved problems. After reviewing the topological background for the Tukey order, I will present a recent development in the theory of the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters on measurable cardinals, and explain how different the situation is when compared to ultrafilters on $&#92;omega$. Moreover, we will see an important application to the Galvin property of ultrafilters. In the second part of the talk, we will demonstrate how ideas and intuition from ultrafilters over measurable cardinals lead to new results on the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters over $&#92;omega$. This is joint with Natasha Dobrinen. </p>

							 <p> A structure, R,  expanding $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt)$ is called component closed if whenever $X &#92;subseteq R^n$ is definable so are all of $X$'s connected components.   Two basic examples of component closed structures are $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt, +, &#92;cdot)$ and $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt, &#92;cdot, &#92;mathbb{Z})$.  It turns out that these two structures are exemplary of a general phenomenon for component closed structures from a broad class of expansions of $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt)$:  either their definable sets are very 'tame' (as in the case of the real closed field) or they are quite 'wild' (as in the case of the real field expanded by the integers).
