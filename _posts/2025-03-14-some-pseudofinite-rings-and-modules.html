Recall that a structure is pseudofinite if every sentence satisfied by that structure has a finite model - equivalently, if the structure is elementarily equivalent to an ultraproduct of finite structures. In this talk, I will present some work in progress from two independent projects around pseudofinite rings and pseudofinite modules: one is joint work with Alex Van Abel, the other is work of my PhD student Roberto Torres. These two projects are linked by the important role played by the class of von Neumann regular rings.
