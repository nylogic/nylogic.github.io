Hjorth and Thomas established that the complexity of the isomorphism
problem for torsion-free abelian groups of finite rank grows dramatically higher
as the rank increases&#58;  for each $r$, there is no Borel function $F$ that maps
each rank-$(r+1)$ group $G$ to a rank-$r$ group $F(G)$ in such a way that
$G_0&#92;cong G_1&#92;iff F(G_0)&#92;cong F(G_1)$.  We say that there is no <em>Borel reduction</em>
from isomorphism on $&#92;operatorname{TFAb}_{r+1}$ to isomorphism
on $&#92;operatorname{TFAb}_r$.  (From lower to higher rank, in contrast,
such a reduction is readily seen.)

Fields of transcendence degree $r$ over $&#92;mathbb Q$ have very similar computability
properties to groups in $&#92;operatorname{TFAb}_r$.  This being so,
we extend their investigations to include the isomorphism relations on
the classes $&#92;operatorname{FD}_r$ of such fields.
We show that there do exist reductions (not merely Borel,
but actually computable, and moreover functorial)
from each $&#92;operatorname{TFAb}_r$ to the corresponding
$&#92;operatorname{FD}_r$, and also from each $&#92;operatorname{FD}_r$
to $&#92;operatorname{FD}_{r+1}$ (which proves more challenging
than it was for the groups!).  It remains open whether a theorem
analogous to that of Hjorth-Thomas holds for the fields, but we use the
notion of <em>countable reductions</em> to show that the fundamental obstacle
to a reduction from $&#92;operatorname{TFAb}_{r+1}$ to $&#92;operatorname{TFAb}_r$
is the uncountability of these spaces.  This is joint work with
Meng-Che 'Turbo' Ho and Julia Knight.
