abstract: "
<p>As the history goes, and was confirmed recently [vP20], G&ouml;del first proved his first incompleteness theorem [G31] for <i>sound</i> theories (that extend <i>Principia Mathematica</i>). Later he weakened the soundness condition to &ldquo;&aleph;<sub>0</sub>-consistency&rdquo;, which later evolved to &ldquo;<i>&omega;</i>-consistency&rdquo;. This condition was needed for irrefutability of (what is now called) G&ouml;delian sentences; the simple consistency of a theory suffices for the unprovability of such sentences. G&ouml;del already notes in [G31] that a necessary and sufficient condition for the independence of G&ouml;delian sentences of <i>T</i> is just a bit more than the simple consistency of <i>T</i>: the consistency of <i>T</i> with Con<sub><i>T</i></sub>, the consistency statement of <i>T</i>.
<br/>In this talk, we ask the following questions and attempt at answering them, at least partially.
<ol>
  <li>Why on earth G&ouml;del [G31] had to introduce this rather strange notion?</li>
  <li>Does it have any applications in other areas of logic, arithmetical theories, or mathematics?</li>
  <li>What was G&ouml;del&rsquo;s reason that <i>&omega;</i>-consistency is &ldquo;much weaker&rdquo; than soundness? He does prove in [G31]  that consistency is weaker (if not much weaker) than <i>&omega;</i>-consistency; but never mentions a proof or even a hint as to why soundness is (much) stronger than <i>&omega;</i>-consistency!</li>
  <li>Other than those historical and philosophical questions, is this a useful notion worthy of further study?</li>
</ol>
We will also review some properties of <i>&omega;</i>-consistency in the talk.
