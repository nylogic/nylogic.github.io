The Borel hierarchy gives a robust way to stratify the complexity of sets of countable structures and is intimately tied with definability in infinitary logic via the Lopez-Escobar theorem. However, what happens with sets axiomatizable in finitary first-order logic, such as the set of structures satisfying a given finitary first-order theory T? Is the complexity of the set of T's models in any way related to the quantifier complexity of the sentences axiomatizing it? In particular, if a theory T is not axiomatizable by a set of sentences of bounded quantifier complexity, can the set of models of T still be at a finite level of the Borel hierarchy?
</p><p>
In this talk, we will present results concerning these questions&#58;
</p><p>
In joint work with Andrews, Gonzalez, Lempp, and Zhu we show that the set of models of a theory T is $&#92;Pi^0_&#92;omega$-complete if and only if T does not have an axiomatization by sentences of bounded quantifier complexity, answering the last question in the negative. We also characterize the Borel complexity of the set of models of complete theories in terms of their finitary axiomatizations. Our results suggest that infinitary logic does not provide any efficacy when defining first-order properties, a phenomenon already observed by Wadge and Keisler and, recently, rediscovered by Harrison-Trainor and Kretschmer using different techniques.
</p><p>
Combining our results with recent results by Enayat and Visser, we obtain that a large class of theories studied in the foundations of mathematics, sequential theories, have a maximal complicated set of models.
