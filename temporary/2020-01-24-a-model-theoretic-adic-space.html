abstract: "Working in the theory of algebraically closed valued fields,
Hrushovski and Loeser used the space $&#92;widehat{V}$ of generically
stable types concentrating on $V$ to study the topology of Berkovich
analytification $V^{an}$ of $V$. In this talk we will present an analogous
construction which provides a model-theoretic counterpart
$&#92;widetilde{V}$ of the Huber's analytification of $V$. We show that, the
same as for $&#92;widehat{V}$, the space $&#92;widetilde{V}$ is strict pro-definable. 
Furthermore, we will discuss canonical liftings of the deformation retraction
developed by Hrushovski and Loeser. This is a joint project with Pablo Cubides Kovacsics."
