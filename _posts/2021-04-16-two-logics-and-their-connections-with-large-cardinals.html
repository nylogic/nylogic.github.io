<p>
In the past couple of years I have been involved (joint work with Väänänen and independently with Shelah) with some logics in the vicinity of Shelah's $&#92;mathbb L^1_&#92;kappa$ (a logic from 2012 that has Interpolation and a very weak notion of compactness, namely Strong Undefinability of Well-Orderings, and in some cases has a Lindström-type theorem for those two properties). Our work with Väänänen weakens the logic but keeps several properties. Our work with Shelah explores the connection with definability of AECs.</p>
<p>
These logics seem to have additional interesting properties under the further assumption of strong compactness of a cardinal, and this brings them close to recent work of Boney, Dimopoulos, Gitman and Magidor [BDGM].</p>
<p>
During the first lecture, I plan to describe two games and a syntax of two logics: Shelah's $&#92;mathbb L^1_&#92;kappa$ and my own logic (joint work with Väänänen) $&#92;mathbb L^{1,c}_&#92;kappa$. I will stress some of the properties of these logics, without any use of large cardinal assumptions.</p>
<p>
During the second lecture, I plan to enter rather uncharted territory. I will describe some constructions done by Shelah (mostly) under the assumption of strong compactness, but I also plan to bring these logics to a territory closer to the work of [BDGM]. This second lecture will have more conjectures, ideas, and (hopefully interesting) discussions with some of the authors of that paper.
