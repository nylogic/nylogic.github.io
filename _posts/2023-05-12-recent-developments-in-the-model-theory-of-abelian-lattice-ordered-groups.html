An Abelian lattice-ordered group ($&#92;ell$-group) is an Abelian group with a partial ordering, invariant under translations, that is a lattice ordering. A prototypical example of an $&#92;ell$-group is $C(X)$, the continuous real-valued functions on the topological space $X$ with pointwise operations and ordering. Let $&#92;bf{A}$ be the class of $&#92;ell$-groups, viewed as structures for the first-order language $&#92;mathcal{L}=&#92;{+,-, 0, &#92;wedge, &#92;vee &#92;}$. After giving more background on $&#92;ell$-groups, I will survey what is known about the $&#92;ell$-groups existentially closed (e.c.) in $&#92;bf{A}$, including some new examples I constructed using Fraïssé limits. Then I will discuss some recently published work of Scowcroft concerning the $&#92;ell$-groups e.c. in $&#92;bf{W}^+$, the class of nonzero Archimedean $&#92;ell$-groups with distinguished strong order unit (viewed as structures for $&#92;mathcal{L}_1 = &#92;mathcal{L} &#92;cup &#92;{1 &#92;}$). Building on Scowcroft's results, I will present new axioms for the $&#92;ell$-groups e.c. in $&#92;bf{W}^+$ and show how they allow one to characterize those spaces $X$ for which $(C(X), 1_X)$ is e.c. in $&#92;bf{W}^+$.
