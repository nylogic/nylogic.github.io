When considering subrings of the field $&#92;mathbb Q$ of rational numbers, one can view Hilbert's Tenth Problem as an operator, mapping each set $W$ of prime numbers to the set $HTP(R_W)$ of polynomials in $&#92;mathbb Z[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]$ with solutions in the ring $R_W=&#92;mathbb Z[W^{-1}]$. The set $HTP(R_{&#92;emptyset})$ is the original Hilbertâ€™s Tenth Problem, known since 1970 to be undecidable.  If $W$ contains all primes, then one gets $HTP(&#92;mathbb Q)$, whose decidability status is open.  In between lie continuum-many other subrings of $&#92;mathbb Q$.

We will begin by discussing topological and measure-theoretic results on the space of all subrings of $&#92;mathbb Q$, which is homeomorphic to Cantor space.  Then we will present a recent result by Ken Kramer and the speaker, showing that the HTP operator does not preserve Turing reducibility.  Indeed, in some cases it reverses it:  one can have $V<_T W$, yet $HTP(R_W) <_T HTP(R_V)$.  Related techniques reveal that every Turing degree contains a set $W$ which is <em>HTP-complete</em>, with $W'&#92;leq_1 HTP(R_W)$.  On the other hand, the earlier results imply that very few sets $W$ have this property&#58;  the collection of all HTP-complete sets is meager and has measure $0$ in Cantor space.
