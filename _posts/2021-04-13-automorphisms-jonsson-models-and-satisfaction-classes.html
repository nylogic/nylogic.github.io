<p>
25 years ago I wrote a paper on four open problems concerning recursively saturated
models of PA. The problems are still open. I will talk about two of them: (1) Let M be
a countable recursively saturated model of PA. Can every  automorphism of M be 
extended to some recursively saturated elementary end extension of M? (2) Is there 
a recursively saturated model of PA that has no recursively saturated elementary submodel
of the same cardinality as the model? I will present some partial results involving partial 
inductive satisfaction classes.
