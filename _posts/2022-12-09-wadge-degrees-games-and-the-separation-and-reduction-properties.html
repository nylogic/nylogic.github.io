In this talk, I will give an overview of the picture of the Borel Wadge degrees.  Our system of descriptions allows us to describe their Delta-classes, as well as specify which degrees have the separation or reduction properties.  Part of our analysis is based on playing games along our descriptions, and so I will explain how these games are played and what they can tell us.
