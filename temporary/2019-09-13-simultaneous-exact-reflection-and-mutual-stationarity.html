abstract: "I will talk about a strengthening of a classical result of Foreman and Magidor, which states that any sequence of stationary subsets of distinct regular cardinals, each set consisting of ordinals of countable cofinality, is mutually stationary. The strengthening allows us to conclude a form of simultaneous reflection of stationarity which guarantees the existence of a mutually stationary sequence of exact reflection points, as a consequence of the subcomplete forcing axiom, and in fact of a weaker principle that corresponds to the subcomplete fragment of the well-known strong reflection principle."
