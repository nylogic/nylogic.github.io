abstract: "<p>
I shall discuss recent joint work with Victoria Gitman and Asaf Karagila, in which we proved that Kelley-Morse set theory (which includes the global choice principle) does not prove the class Fodor principle, the assertion that every regressive class function $F:S&#92;to {&#92;rm Ord}$ defined on a stationary class $S$ is constant on a stationary subclass. Indeed, it is relatively consistent with KM for any infinite $&#92;lambda$ with $&#92;omega&#92;leq&#92;lambda&#92;leq{&#92;rm Ord}$ that there is a class function $F:{&#92;rm Ord}&#92;to&#92;lambda$ that is not constant on any stationary class. Strikingly, it is consistent with KM that there is a sequence of classes $A_n$, each containing a class club, but the intersection of all $A_n$ is empty. Consequently, it is relatively consistent with KM that the class club filter is not $&#92;sigma$-closed.
