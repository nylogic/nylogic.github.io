abstract: "
<p>I will survey some well-known and some more recent undefinability results about models of Peano Arithmetic. I want to contrast first-order undefinability in the standard model with a much stronger notion of undefinability which is suitable for resplendent models, and use the results to motivate some more general questions about the nature of undefinability.
