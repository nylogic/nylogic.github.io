Let $n &#92;lt &#92;omega$ and $&#92;Gamma$ either $&#92;Pi$ or $&#92;Sigma$. An ordinal
$&#92;alpha$ is called $&#92;Gamma^1_n$-reflecting if for each $&#92;beta &#92;lt&#92;alpha$
and each $&#92;Gamma^1_n$-formula $&#92;varphi$ if $L_&#92;alpha &#92;models
&#92;varphi(&#92;beta)$ then there is a $&#92;gamma &#92;in (&#92;beta, &#92;alpha)$ so that
$L_&#92;gamma &#92;models &#92;varphi(&#92;beta)$ where here $&#92;models$ refers to full
second order logic. The least $&#92;Sigma^1_n$-reflecting ordinal is called
$&#92;sigma^1_n$ and the least $&#92;Pi^1_n$-ordinal is called $&#92;pi^1_n$. These
ordinals provably exist and are countable (for all $n &#92;lt &#92;omega$). They
arise naturally in proof theory, particularly in calibrating consistency
strength of strong arithmetics and weak set theories. Moreover,
surprisingly, their relation to one another relies heavily on the
background set theory. If $V=L$ then for all $n &#92;lt &#92;omega$ we have
$&#92;sigma^1_{n+3} &#92;lt &#92;pi^1_{n+3}$ (due to Cutland) while under PD for all
$n &#92;lt &#92;omega$ we have $&#92;sigma^1_n &#92;lt &#92;pi^1_n$ if and only if $n$ is even
(due to Kechris).
<br>
Surprisingly nothing was known about these ordinals in any model which
satisfies neither $V=L$ nor PD. In this talk I will sketch some recent
results which aim at rectifying this. In particular we will show that in
any generic extension by any number of Cohen or Random reals, a Sacks,
Miller or Laver real, or any lightface, weakly homogeneous Borel ccc
forcing notion agrees with $L$ about which ordinals are
$&#92;Gamma^1_n$-reflecting (for any $n$ and $&#92;Gamma$). Meanwhile, in the
generic extension by collapsing $&#92;omega_1$ many interesting things
happen, not least amongst them that $&#92;sigma^1_n$ and $&#92;pi^1_n$ are
increased - yet still below $&#92;omega_1^L$ for $n > 2$. Along the way we
will discuss the plethora of open problems in this area. This is joint
work with Juan Aguilera.
