We investigate which forcing notions can be embedded into a Tree-Prikry forcing. It turns out that the answer changes drastically under different large cardinal assumptions. We will focus on the class of $&#92;kappa&#92;text{-}$strategically closed forcings of cardinality $&#92;kappa$, $&lt;&#92;kappa&#92;text{-}$strategically closed forcings of cardinality $&#92;kappa$ and the $&#92;kappa&#92;text{-}$distributive forcing notions of cardinality $&#92;kappa$. Then we will examine distributive subforcings of the Prikry forcing of cardinality larger than $&#92;kappa$.
This is a joint work with Moti Gitik and Yair Hayut.
