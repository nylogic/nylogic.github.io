abstract: "<p>
A one-dimensional asymptotic class, as introduced by Macpherson and
Steinhorn in 2008, is a collection of finite structures whose
definable subsets in a single variable grow approximately linearly
with respect to the size of the structure, in a definable and
well-behaved fashion. The motivating example is the collection of
finite fields, as proved by Chatzidakis, van den Dries and Macintyre
in 1992. In this talk, we survey Steinhorn and Macpherson's
foundational 2008 paper. We give examples and nonexamples of
one-dimensional asymptotic classes, as well as more general notions
such as N-dimensional and multidimensional classes. We show how
infinite ultra-products of one-dimensional asymptotic classes are
model-theoretically nice, with particular emphasis on the existence of
a well-behaved dimension and measure on definable subsets and the
consequences of such.
