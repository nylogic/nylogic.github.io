This talk is about the relationship between (weak) arithmetical theories and
methods for automated inductive theorem proving. Automating the search for
proofs by induction is an important topic in computer science with a history
that stretches back decades. A variety of different approaches, algorithms and
implementations has been developed.
</p><p>
In this talk I will present a logical approach for understanding the power and
limits of methods for automated inductive theorem proving. A central tool are
translations of proof systems that are intended for automated proof search into
weak arithmetical theories. Another central tool are non-standard models of
these weak arithmetical theories.
</p><p>
This approach allows to obtain independence results which are of practical
interest in computer science. It also gives rise to a number of new problems
and questions about weak arithmetical theories.
