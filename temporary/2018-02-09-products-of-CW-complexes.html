abstract: "CW complexes are the topological spaces of choice for algebraic topology, but the product (as topological spaces) of two CW complexes need not be a CW complex.  In the 1940s and 50s Whitehead and Milnor gave sufficient conditions for the product to be a CW complex, and in the 70s and 80s Liu and Tanaka gave characterisations of those pairs of CW complexes whose product is a CW complex, under the assumption of set-theoretic axioms such as CH.  In this talk I will present a new characterisation of the pairs of CW complexes whose product is a CW complex, valid in any model of set theory (ie, without any such extra set-theoretic assumptions).  Whilst I have stripped the set theory away from the assumptions on the universe, the characterisation is with reference to a cardinal that may not be familiar to non-set theorists: the bounding number."
