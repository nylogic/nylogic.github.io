The infinitary logic $L_{&#92;omega_1, &#92;omega}$ extends first-order logic by allowing countable disjunctions and conjunctions of formulas. Every countable structure can be described up to isomorphism (within the class of countable structures) by an $L_{&#92;omega_1, &#92;omega}$ sentence. This gives rise to a particular way of measuring the complexity of countable structures: there is a natural alternation hierarchy $(&#92;Pi^{&#92;text{in}}_&#92;alpha: &#92;alpha &#92;lt &#92;omega_1)$ of $L_{&#92;omega_1, &#92;omega}$ formulas, and the Scott rank of a structure $A$ is the smallest ordinal $&#92;alpha$ such that $A$ can be described up to isomorphism by a $&#92;Pi^{&#92;text{in}}_{&#92;alpha+1}$ sentence.

In recent years, beginning with a paper by Montalban and Rossegger, the Scott rank of models of arithmetic has attracted some attention. We now know, for instance, that every nonstandard pointwise definable model of ${&#92;rm PA}$ has Scott rank at least omega, that all other nonstandard models of ${&#92;rm PA}$ must have rank at least $&#92;omega+1$, and that recursively saturated models of ${&#92;rm PA}$ have rank exactly $&#92;omega+1$. This naturally leads one to ask about possible Scott ranks of models of subtheories of ${&#92;rm PA}$. In particular: what is the lowest possible Scott rank of a structure satisfying $I&#92;Sigma_n + &#92;lnot B&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$? What about $B&#92;Sigma_n + &#92;lnot I&#92;Sigma_n$?
</p><p>
We prove that every nonstandard model of $B&#92;Sigma_n$ must have Scott rank at least $n+1$. Moreover, this lower bound is tight&#58; it is realized both by the most familiar models of $I&#92;Sigma_n + &#92;lnot B&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$, namely pointwise $&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$-definable substructures of models of $I&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$, and by the most familiar models of $B&#92;Sigma_n + &#92;lnot I&#92;Sigma_n$, namely initial segments generated by the $&#92;Sigma_n$-definables of models of $I&#92;Sigma_n$. Time permitting, we also hope to mention a few other facts about Scott ranks of models of fragments of ${&#92;rm PA}$.
