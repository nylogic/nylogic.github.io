This talk reports on research in collaboration with Ali Enayat and Mateusz Łełyk.</p>
<p></p>
Steffen Lempp and Dino Rossegger asked&#58; is there a consistent completion of ${&#92;sf PA}^-$ that is axiomatised by sentences of bounded quantifier-alternation complexity? We show that there is no such restricted completion. We also show that, if one changes the measure of complexity to being $&#92;Sigma_n$, there is a restricted completion. Specifically, we show that the true theory of the non-negative part of $&#92;mathbb Z[X]$ can be axiomatised by a single sentence plus a set of $&#92;Sigma^0_1$-sentences.</p><p>
<p>
In our talk we will sketch these two answers. One of our aims is to make clear is that the negative answer for the case of quantifier-alternation complexity simply follows from Rosser's Theorem viewed from a sufficiently abstract standpoint.</p>
