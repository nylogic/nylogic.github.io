abstract: "
<p>The real numbers are up to isomorphism the only completely
ordered field with a countable dense subset. We consider non-Archimedean
ordered fields whose smallest dense subset has cardinality kappa and
investigate whether anything resembling ordinary analysis works on these
fields.</p>
<p>
In particular, we look at generalisations of the intermediate value
theorem and the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, and realise that there is
some mathematical tension between these theorems: the intermediate value
theorem requires some saturation whereas Bolzano-Weierstrass fails if the
field is saturated. We consider weakenings of Bolzano-Weierstrass
compatible with saturation and realise that these are equivalent to the
weak compactness of kappa.</p>
<p>
This is joint work with Merlin Carl, Lorenzo Galeotti, and Aymane Hanafi.</p>
