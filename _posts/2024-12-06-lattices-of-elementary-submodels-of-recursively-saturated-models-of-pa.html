<p>
Much work on  elementary submodels of recursively saturated models
of PA was done, beginning in the 1980s, by Craig Smory≈Ñski, Richard Kaye,
Henryk Kotlarski,  Jim Schmerl, and myself.  The set of all elementary  substructures of a
recursively saturated model $M$ ordered by inclusion forms a lattice $Lt(M)$.
Kotlarski asked whether $Lt(M)$ depends on $M$.  In the talk, I will describe
the architecture of $Lt(M)$, and I will survey what is known and what is still
open about Kotlarski's question.
