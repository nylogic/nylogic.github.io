abstract: "
Cofinal extensions generally preserve many more properties of a model of arithmetic than their sisters, end extensions.  Exactly how much must or can they preserve?  The answer is intimately related to how much arithmetic the model can do.  I will survey what is known and what is not known about this question, and report on some recent work on this line.
