<p>
A dimension group is a partially ordered Abelian group whose partial order is isolated and directed and has the Riesz interpolation property.  A dimension group is simple just in case it has no nontrivial ideals, ideals being directed convex subgroups.  By concentrating on the behavior of positive formulas in simple dimension groups, this talk will reveal a well-behaved part of their model theory.
