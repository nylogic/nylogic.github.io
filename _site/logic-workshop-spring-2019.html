							 <p align='center'><strong>Abstract</strong></p> <p> <strong>Definition</strong>: A collection $&#92;mathcal F$ of forbidden subgraphs is a <em>Rado family</em> if the class of countable $&#92;mathcal F$-free graphs contains a universal structure with respect to embeddings as induced subgraphs. (By 'forbidden' I mean forbidden as subgraphs;  usage varies in the literature.) </p> <p> We consider the following decision problem for Rado families. </p> <p> <strong>Problem</strong>: Given a finite set $&#92;mathcal F$ of finite, connected graphs, determine whether or not it is a Rado family. </p> <p> <strong>Question</strong>: Is this a decidable problem? </p> <p> If we specialize to the sake of a single constraint then we speak instead of a <em>Rado constraint.</em> Much is known, and much more conjectured, about the case of a <em>single</em> constraint. </p> <p> <strong>Conjecture</strong>: The decision problem for the case of a single constraint is decidable. </p> <p align='center'><strong>Discussion</strong></p> <p> From the model theoretic side, a finite collection of forbidden subgraphs specifies a universal theory with some special properties&#58; notably, there is a <em>model companion</em>. When we restrict to families of connected constraints, the theory has joint embedding and the model companion is complete. In model theoretic terms the question becomes whether the model companion has a countable universal model with respect to elementary embedding, for which a purely type theoretic criterion is known. </p> <p> Decision problems for other model theoretic properties of the model companion are natural. We have focused on this one because the question came to us from graph theory. However, even in that form, two variants are relevant. <ul> <li>Can we decide whether the model companion is $&#92;aleph_0$-categorical?</li> <li>Dropping the connectedness hypothesis on the constraints, can we decide whether the model companion is complete?</li> </ul> </p> <p> The main source of positive answers to the universality problem appears to be the $&#92;aleph_0$-categorical case, and this has some theoretical justification. The most direct route to understanding the original graph theoretical problem appears to take the detour through $&#92;aleph_0$-categoricity. </p> <p> As time allows, I would like to discuss the following three points. <ul> <li>What we know, and what we expect, in the case of a single constraint;</li> <li>Methods of proof (<em>algebraic closure; induction by pruning</em>);</li> <li>The status of the decision problem for j.e.p. and its analog in the theory of permutation pattern classes (work of Braunfeld).</li> </ul> </p> <p> This is joint work with Shelah, e.g. [Sh689]. </p>

							<p> A <em>Turing computable embedding</em> is a Turing operator that maps one class of structures to another so as to preserve isomorphism. The embedding codes the input structure in the output structure. It is interesting when there is an effective decoding. It is also interesting when the decoding is very difficult. Recently, Harrison-Trainor, Melnikov, R. Miller, and Montalb√°n have defined very general notions of interpretation, in which the interpreting formulas have no fixed arity. Uniformly defined interpretations give us decoding. I will discuss some known Turing computable embeddings, looking for uniform interpretations that yield effective, or Borel, decoding.
<ol> <li> Marker's embedding of directed graphs in undirected graphs,</li> <li> Mal'tsev's embedding of fields in groups,</li> <li> Friedman and Stanley's embedding of graphs in linear orderings.</li> </ol> The first two embeddings come with uniform 'effective' interpretations, which give uniform effective decoding. For the third, we do not even have uniform interpretation via $L_{&#92;omega_1&#92;omega}$ formulas. </p>

						<div style="display:none" id="5">
							<p> Ramsey's Theorem for pairs and 2 colors says that for every 2-coloring, $C$, of pairs of natural numbers, there is an infinite set $H$, such that all pairs from $H$ have the same constant color.  $H$ is called a <em>homogeneous</em> set for $C$.  We will also consider Ramsey's Theorem in other settings.  For example, we can be given countably many $1$-colorings of natural numbers, $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$, and ask for a set $C$ such that, for each $i$, all but finitely many elements of $C$ have the same color with respect to $c_i$.  Call $C$ a <em>cohesive</em> set for $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$.
Among the questions we will explore here is what can be computed from homogeneous sets.  For example, given countably many $1$-colorings $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$, is there a 2-coloring $C$, such that every homogeneous set for $C$ computes a <em>cohesive</em> set for $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$? </p>

Some of these results can be stated more generally using a natural classification of definable partial orders in terms of amalgamation properties. </p>

						<div style="display:none" id="10">
							<p> Generic elementary embeddings have many applications throughout set theory. For example, Solovay's original proof that every stationary subset of a regular uncountable cardinal $&#92;kappa$ can be partitioned into $&#92;kappa$ disjoint stationary sets involves the use of a generic ultrapower embedding obtained by forcing with the nonstationary ideal. The generic ultrapower construction leads naturally to a characterization of the nonstationary ideal on a regular uncountable cardinal $&#92;textrm{NS}_&#92;kappa$ in terms of generic elementary embeddings. We will show that this characterization can be generalized to various ideals associated to large cardinals. Specifically, we will discuss characterizations of the $&#92;Pi^m_n$-indescribability ideals, the subtle ideal and the ineffability ideal in terms of generic elementary embeddings as well as potential applications. </p>

						<div style="display:none" id="12">
							<p> A sequence of random variables is exchangeable when its distribution is invariant to reorderings of the sequence. This notion of symmetry and its generalizations to arrays, graphs, and other structures, arise in many statistical contexts. Representation theorems due to de Finetti, Aldous-Hoover, and others, describe how exchangeable structures can be written in a way that exposes conditional independence, which is often important for computational purposes. However, these results are not obviously computable. We will present several positive and negative results examining the computable content of these theorems, and will also describe several implications for the design of probabilistic programming languages.
