<p>
A central question in the theory of large cardinals was whether the existence of a model of ZFC with exactly two normal measures follows from the consistency of ZFC with a measurable cardinal. This was answered positively by a landmark theorem of Friedman and Magidor, whose proof masterfully combined advanced techniques in the theory of large cardinals, including generalized Sacks forcing, forcing over canonical inner models, coding posets, and nonstationary support iterations.</p>
<p>
In this talk, we present a new and simpler proof of the Friedman-Magidor theorem. A notable feature of our approach is that it avoids any use of inner model theory, making it applicable in the presence of very large cardinals that are beyond the current reach of the inner model program. If time permits, we will also discuss additional applications of the technique: the construction of ZFC models with several normal measures but a single normal ultrapower; a nontrivial model of the weak Ultrapower Axiom from the optimal large cardinal assumption; and a generalization of the Friedmanâ€“Magidor theorem to extenders.
