(One version of) Cantor's second best theorem states that every pair of
countable, dense sets of reals are isomorphic as linear orders. From the
perspective of set theory it's natural to ask whether some variant of
this theorem can hold consistently when 'countable' is replaced by
'uncountable'. This was shown in the affirmative by Baumgartner in 1973
who showed the consistency of 'all $&#92;aleph_1$-dense sets of reals are
order isomorphic' where a set is $&#92;kappa$-dense for a cardinal $&#92;kappa$
if its intersection with any open interval has size $&#92;kappa$. The above
became known as Baumgartner's axiom, denoted BA, and is an important
axiom in both combinatorial set theory and set theoretic topology. BA
has natural higher dimensional analogues - i.e., statements with the same
relation to $&#92;mathbb R^n$ that BA has to $&#92;mathbb R$. It is a long
standing open conjecture of Steprāns and Watson that BA implies its
higher dimensional analogues.

In the talk I will describe some attempts to break the ice on this open
problem mostly by looking at a family of weaker and stronger variants of
BA and investigating their combinatorial, analytic and topological
consequences. We will show that while some weak variants of BA have all
the same consequences as BA, even weaker ones do not. Meanwhile a
strengthening of BA for Baire and Polish space gives much more
information.
