abstract: "In this talk I will discuss some of the definitions and results from the 1975 paper 'Flipping properties&#58; A unifying thread in the theory of large cardinals' by Abramson, Harrington, Kleinberg, and Zwicker. I will introduce flipping properties, and show how they can be used to characterize inaccessible, weakly compact, and measurable cardinals."
