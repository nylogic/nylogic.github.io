abstract: "<p>The Wadge hierarchy was originally defined and
studied only in the Baire space (and some other
zero-dimensional spaces). We extend it to arbitrary
topological spaces by providing a set-theoretic definition
of all its levels. We show that our extension behaves well
in  second countable spaces and especially in quasi-Polish
spaces. In particular, all levels are preserved by
continuous open surjections between second countable
spaces, which implies, e.g., several
Hausdorff-Kuratowski-type theorems in quasi-Polish spaces.
In fact, many results hold not only for the Wadge
hierarchy of sets but also for its extension to Borel
functions from a space to a countable better quasiorder Q.</p>"
