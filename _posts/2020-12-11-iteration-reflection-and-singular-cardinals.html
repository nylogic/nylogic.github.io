abstract: "

<p>There is an inherent tension between stationary reflection and the failure of the singular cardinal hypothesis (SCH). The former is a compactness type principle that follows from large cardinals. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property holds for every smaller substructure of an object, then it holds for the entire object. In contrast, failure of SCH is an instance of incompactness.  </p>
<p>
Two classical results of Magidor are:  <br>
(1) from large cardinals it is consistent to have reflection at $&#92;aleph_{&#92;omega+1}$, and <br>
(2) from large cardinals it is consistent to have the failure of SCH at $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$.</p>
<p>
As  these principles are at odds with each other, the natural question is whether we can have both. We show the answer is yes.</p>
<p>
We describe a Prikry style iteration, and use it to force stationary reflection in the presence of not SCH.  Then we obtain this situation at $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$ by interleaving collapses. This is joint work with Alejandro Poveda and Assaf Rinot.</p>
