abstract: "
<p> The Heisenberg group G(F) of a field F is the group of upper triangular matrices
in GL_3(F), with 1's along the diagonal and 0's below it.  This group is obviously
interpretable (indeed definable) in the field F.  Mal'cev showed that one can recover
F from G(F), and indeed that there is an interpretation of F in G(F) using two
parameters.  Any two noncommuting elements of G(F) can serve as the parameters,
but Mal'cev was unable to produce an interpretation without parameters.
</p><p>
After introducing the notions of a <em>computable functor</em> and an
<em>effective interpretation</em>, we will present joint work showing that there
is an effective interpretation of each countable field in its Heisenberg group,
without parameters, uniformly in F.  (That is, the same formulas give the
interpretation, no matter which field F we consider.)  Moreover, from the
effective interpretation we will then extract a traditional interpretation
without parameters, in the usual model-theoretic sense.  Finally we will
note that, whereas Mal'cev's result actually gives a definition of F in G(F),
there is no parameter-free definition of F there.
