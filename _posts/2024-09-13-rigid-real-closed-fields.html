abstract: "
<p>
Shelah showed that it is consistent that there are uncountable rigid non-archimedean
real closed fields and, later, he and Mekler proved this in $&#92;textbf{ZFC}$.
Answering a question of Enayat,
Charlie Steinhorn and I show that there are countable rigid non-archimedean
real closed fields by constructing one of transcendence degree two.
