abstract: "<p>A model $M$ of set theory is said to be 'condensable' if
there is an 'ordinal' $&#92;alpha$ of $M$ such that the rank initial
segment of $M$ determined by $&#92;alpha$  is both isomorphic to $M$, and
an elementary submodel of $M$ for infinitary formulae appearing in the
well-founded part of $M$.  Clearly if $M$ is condensable, then $M$ is
ill-founded. The work of Barwise and Schlipf in the mid 1970s showed
that countable recursively saturated models of ZF are condensable.</p>
<p>
In this two-part talk, we present a number of new results related to
condensable models, including the following two theorems.</p>
<p>
Theorem 1. Assuming that there is a well-founded model of ZFC plus
'there is an inaccessible cardinal', there is a condensable model $M$
of ZFC which has the property that every definable element of $M$ is
in the well-founded part of $M$ (in particular, $M$ is
$&#92;omega$-standard, and therefore not recursively saturated).</p>
<p>
Theorem 2. The following are equivalent for an ill-founded model $M$
of ZF of any cardinality&#58;<br>
(a) $M$ is expandable to Gödel-Bernays class theory plus
$&#92;Delta^1_1$-Comprehension.<br>
(b) There is a cofinal subset of 'ordinals' $&#92;alpha$ of $M$ such that
the rank initial segment of $M$ determined by $&#92;alpha$  is an
elementary submodel of $M$ for infinitary formulae appearing in the
well-founded part of $M.$<br>
Moreover, if $M$ is a countable ill-founded model of ZFC, then
conditions (a) and (b) above are equivalent to&#58;<br>
(c) $M$ is expandable to Gödel-Bernays class theory plus
$&#92;Delta^1_1$-Comprehension + $&#92;Sigma^1_2$-Choice.</p>"
