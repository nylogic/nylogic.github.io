abstract: "Recall that given a complete theory $T$ and a type $p(x)$ the <em>Hanf number for</em> $p(x)$ is the least cardinal $&#92;kappa$ so that any model of $T$ of size $&#92;kappa$ realizes $p(x)$ (if such a $&#92;kappa$ exists and $&#92;infty$ otherwise). The <em>Hanf number for</em> $T$, denoted $H(T)$, is the supremum of the successors of the Hanf numbers for all possible types $p(x)$ whose Hanf numbers are $&#92;lt&#92;infty$. We have seen so far in the seminar that for any complete, consistent $T$ in a countable language $H(T) &#92;leq &#92;beth_{&#92;omega_1}$ (a result due to Morley). In this talk I will present the following theorems: (1) The Hanf number for true arithmetic is $&#92;beth_{&#92;omega}$ (Abrahamson-Harrington-Knight) but (2) the Hanf number for False Arithmetic is $&#92;beth_{&#92;omega_1}$ (Abrahamson-Harrington)"
