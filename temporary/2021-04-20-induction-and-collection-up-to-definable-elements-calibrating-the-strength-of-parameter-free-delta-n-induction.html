<p>
 In this talk we shall deal with fragments of first-order Peano Arithmetic obtained by restricting 
the conclusion of the induction or the collection axiom to elements in a prescribed subclass $D$ of the universe. 
Fix $n>0$. The schemes of $&#92;Sigma_n$-induction up to $&#92;Sigma_m$-definable elements and the schemes of  $&#92;Sigma_n$-collection 
up to $&#92;Sigma_m$-definable elements form two families of subtheories of $I&#92;Sigma_n$ and $B&#92;Sigma_n$, respectively, obtained in this way. </p> 
<p>
The properties of $&#92;Sigma_n$-induction up to $&#92;Sigma_m$-definable elements for $n&#92;geq m$ are reasonably well understood and 
interesting applications of these fragments are known. However, an analysis of the case $n&#60;m$ was pending. In the first part of this talk, 
we address this problem and show that it is related to the following general question: 'Under which conditions on a model $M$ can we prove that 
every non-empty $&#92;Sigma_m$-definable subset of $M$ contains some $&#92;Sigma_m$-definable element?'</p>
<p>
In the second part of the talk, we show that, for each $n&#92;geq 1$, the scheme of $&#92;Sigma_n$-collection up to $&#92;Sigma_n$-definable elements 
provides us with an axiomatization of the $&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$-consequences of $B&#92;Sigma_n$. As an application, we obtain that $B&#92;Sigma_n$ 
is $&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$-conservative over parameter-free $&#92;Delta_n$-minimization (plus $I&#92;Sigma_{n-1}$), thus partially answering a question of R. Kaye.
