abstract: "<p>
In this talk we will give background on $&#92;mathcal{L}_{&#92;infty, &#92;omega}(L)$, categorical logic as well as Grothendieck topoi. We will then show how to make precise a version of Vaught's conjecture for a Grothendieck topos as well as discuss various analogs of Morley's theorem which hold in Grothendeick topoi. If we have time we will also briefly discuss analogs of other theorems of $&#92;mathcal{L}_{&#92;infty, &#92;omega}$ for Grothendieck topoi.
