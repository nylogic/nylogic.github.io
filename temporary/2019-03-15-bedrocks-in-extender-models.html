abstract: "<p>
Let $M$ be an inner model. $M$`s bedrock $B$, provided it exist, is
the $&#92;subseteq$-least inner model such that $M = B[g]$ for some set
generic filter $g$. </p>
<p>
We will discuss the interplay of (internal) iterability, strong
cardinals and the existence of bedrocks in the case that $M$ is an
extender model.
