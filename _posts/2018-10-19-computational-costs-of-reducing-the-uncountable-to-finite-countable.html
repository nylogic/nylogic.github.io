We study the logical and computational properties of basic theorems
of uncountable mathematics, including the Cousin and Lindeloef lemmas,
published in 1895 and 1903.  Historically, these lemmas were among the
first formulations of open-cover compactness and the Lindeloef
property, respectively. These notions are of great conceptual
importance&#58; the former is commonly viewed as a way of treating
uncountable sets like e.g. [0,1] as 'almost finite', while the latter
allows one to treat uncountable sets like e.g. the real numbers R as
'almost countable'.  This reduction of the uncountable to the
finite/countable turns out to have a considerable logical and
computational cost&#58; we show that the aforementioned lemmas, and many
related theorems, are extremely hard to prove, while the associated
sub-covers are extremely hard to compute. Indeed, in terms of the
standard scale (based on comprehension axioms), a proof of these
lemmas requires at least the full extent of second-order arithmetic, a
system originating from Hilbert-Bernays’ Grundlagen der Mathematik.
This observation has far-reaching implications for the Grundlagen's
spiritual successor, the program of Reverse Mathematics, and the
associated Goedel hierachy.  We discuss similar theorems relating to
the gauge integral, a generalisation of the Lebesgue and improper
Riemann integrals that also uniquely provides a direct formalisation
of Feynman's path integral.
