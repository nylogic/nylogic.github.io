abstract: "This is a continuation of my talk from last semester. Many theorems regarding the nonstationary ideal can be generalized to the ideal of non--weakly compact sets. For example, Hellsten showed that under GCH, if $W&#92;subseteq &#92;kappa$ is a weakly compact set then there is a cofinality-preserving forcing extension in which there is a $1$-club $C&#92;subseteq W$ and all weakly compact subsets of $W$ remain weakly compact. I will discuss some recent results in this direction related to the  <em>weakly compact reflection principle</em>, which generalize work of Mekler and Shelah on the nonstationary ideal. One can easily observe that if the weakly compact reflection principle holds at $&#92;kappa$ then $&#92;kappa$ must be $&#92;omega$-weakly compact. By developing a forcing to add a non-reflecting weakly compact set, I will prove that the converse can fail: if $&#92;kappa$ is $(&#92;alpha+1)$-weakly compact then there is a forcing extension in which $&#92;kappa$ remains $&#92;alpha$-weakly compact and the weakly compact reflection principle fails at $&#92;kappa$. I will also discuss a proof of a result joint with Hiroshi Sakai: if the weakly compact reflection principle holds at $&#92;kappa$ then there is a forcing extension preserving this in which $&#92;kappa$ is the least $&#92;omega$-weakly compact cardinal. Hence the weakly compact reflection principle at $&#92;kappa$ need not imply that $&#92;kappa$ is $(&#92;omega+1)$-weakly compact."
