abstract: "
<p> The stationary reflection principle, which is often called the Weak Reflection Principle, is known to have many interesting consequences. As for cardinal arithmetic, it implies that $&#92;lambda^&#92;omega = &#92;lambda$ for all regular cardinal $&#92;lambda &#92;geq &#92;omega_2$. In this talk, we will discuss higher analogues of this stationary reflection principle and their consequences on cardinal arithmetic.
