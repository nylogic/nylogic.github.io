<p>
Gitman, Friedman, and Kanovei described a construction of a model of ZF in which countable choice holds and $&#92;Pi^1_2$-dependent choice for reals is not satisfied. We modify that construction to obtain a model in which (boldface) $&#92;Pi^1_n$-determinacy holds, but which fails to satisfy (lightface) $&#92;Pi^1_{n+2}$-${&#92;rm DC}$ for reals. In particular, we show that no projective level of determinacy implies full ${&#92;rm DC}_{&#92;mathbb R}$. This is joint work with Sandra Müller.
