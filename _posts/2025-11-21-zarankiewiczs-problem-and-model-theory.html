A shower thought that anyone interested in graph theory must have had at some point in their lives is the following: 'How 'sparse' must a given bipartite graph be, if I know that it has no 'dense' subgraphs?'. This curiosity definitely crossed the mind of Polish mathematician K. Zarankiewicz, who asked a version of this question formally in 1951. In the years that followed, many central figures in the development of extremal combinatorics contemplated this problem, giving various kinds of answers. Some of these will be surveyed in the first part of my talk.

So far so good, but this is a logic workshop and the title says the words 'Model Theory'… In the second part of my talk, I will discuss how the celebrated Szemerédi-Trotter theorem gave a starting point to the study of Zarankiewicz's problem in 'geometric' contexts, and how the language of model theory has been able to capture exactly what these contexts are. I will then ramble about improvements to the classical answers to Zarankiewicz's problem, when we restrict our attention to semilinear/semibounded o-minimal structures, Presburger arithmetic, and various kinds of Hrushovski constructions. 

The new results that will appear in the talk have been obtained jointly with Pantelis Eleftheriou.
