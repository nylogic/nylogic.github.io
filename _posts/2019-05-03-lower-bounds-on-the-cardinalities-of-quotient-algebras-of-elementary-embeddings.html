abstract: "<p>
From non-trivial elementary embeddings $j_{1}&#92;dots j_{r}:V_{&#92;lambda}&#92;rightarrow V_{&#92;lambda}$, we obtain a sequence of polynomials $(p_{n}(x_{1},&#92;dots,x_{r}))_{n&#92;in&#92;omega}$ that satisfies the infinite product
$$&#92;prod_{k=0}^{&#92;infty}p_{k}(x_{1},&#92;dots,x_{r})=&#92;frac{1}{1-(x_{1}+&#92;dots+x_{r})}.$$
From this infinite product, we deduce lower bounds of the cardinality of $|&#92;langle j_{1},...,j_{r}&#92;rangle/&#92;equiv^{&#92;alpha}|$ using analysis and analytic number theoretic techniques. Computer calculations that search for Laver-like algebras give some empirical evidence that these lower bounds cannot be greatly improved.
