<p>
I want to argue that when knowing the model-theory of categories, you kind of know the model-theory of any structure. As the ? at the end of the title suggests, some of this is still speculative. </p>
<p>

It is easy to see a category as a first-order structure in the two-sorted language (for objects and morphisms) of categories; a little less to do this foundationally correct (I have given a talk a way back in which I ignored these issues, but I will correct this in the talk, although not mentioning them in this abstract). Now, to any theory T in some first-order language L, we can associate a theory in the language of categories, cat(T), which reflects this theory: the models of cat(T) are isomorphic (as categories) with subcategories of the category Mod(T) of models of T.  In fact, any category that is elementary equivalent with Mod(T) is a sub-model of the latter.</p>
<p>
This translation from T into cat(T)---from an arbitrary signature to a fixed one---is still mysterious, and as of now, I only know a very few concrete cases. A key role seems to be played by the theory FO, consisting of all sentences in the language of categories which hold in each category of L-structures, for all possible languages L. But I do not even know yet a full axiomatization of FO.
