<p>
Assume that $&#92;mathbb P$ is a forcing notion, $G$ is a generic set for it over the ground model $V$, and a cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is measurable in the generic extension. Let $j$  be an ultrapower embedding, taken in $V[G]$ with a normal measure on $&#92;kappa$. We consider the following questions:
</p>
<p>
1. Is the restriction of $j$ to $V$ an iterated ultrapower of $V$ (by its measures or extenders)?
</p><p>
2. Is the restriction of $j$ to $V$ definable in $V$?
</p>
<p>

By a work of Schindler [1], the answer to the first question is affirmative, assuming that there is no inner model with a Woodin Cardinal and $V=K$ is the core model. By a work of Hamkins [2], the answer to the second question is positive for forcing notions which admit a Gap below $&#92;kappa$.</p>
<p>
We will address the above questions in the context of nonstationary-support iteration of Prikry forcings below a measurable cardinal $&#92;kappa$. Assuming GCH only in the ground model, we provide a positive answer for the first question, and describe in detail the structure of $j$ restricted to $V$ as an iteration of $V$. The answer to the second question may go either way, depending on the choice of the measures used in the Prikry forcings along the iteration; we will provide a simple sufficient condition for the positive answer. This is a joint work with Moti Gitik.</p><p>
