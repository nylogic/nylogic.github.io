abstract: "
<p>The talk will be a survey of results on first-order theories of pairs (N,M),
where M is a model of PA and N is its elementary extension, under various
assumptions on the models and on the type of extension. In particular,
I will discuss in detail the results on countable recursively saturated models
and their cofinal submodels from a joint paper with Jim Schmerl.</p>
