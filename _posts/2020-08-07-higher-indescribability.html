abstract: "To what extent can formulas from infinitary logics be used in set-theoretic reflection arguments? If $&#92;kappa$ is a measurable cardinal, any $L_{&#92;kappa,&#92;kappa}$ sentence which is true in $(&#92;kappa,&#92;in)$, must be true about some strictly smaller cardinal. Whereas, there are $L_{&#92;kappa^+,&#92;kappa^+}$ sentences of length $&#92;kappa$ which are true in $(&#92;kappa,&#92;in)$ and which are not true about any smaller cardinal. However, if $&#92;kappa$ is a measurable cardinal and some $L_{&#92;kappa^+,&#92;kappa^+}$ sentence $&#92;varphi$ is true in $(&#92;kappa,&#92;in)$, then there must be some strictly smaller cardinal $&#92;alpha<&#92;kappa$ such that a canonically restricted version of $&#92;varphi$ holds about $&#92;alpha$. Building on work of Bagaria and Sharpe-Welch, we use canonical restriction of formulas to define notions of $&#92;Pi^1_&#92;xi$-indescribability of a cardinal $&#92;kappa$ for all $&#92;xi<&#92;kappa^+$. In this context we show that such higher indescribability hypotheses are strictly weaker than measurability, we prove the existence of universal $&#92;Pi^1_&#92;xi$-formulas, study the associated normal ideals and notions of $&#92;xi$-clubs and prove a hierarchy result. Time permitting we will discuss some applications."
