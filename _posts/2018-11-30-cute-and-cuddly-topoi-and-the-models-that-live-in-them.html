abstract: "<p>
Topoi are fundamental mathematical objects which lie at the crossroads between set theory, model theory, algebraic geometry and topology. One of the many ways of viewing a topos is as a mathematical universe with enough structure to contain models of first order theories. In this talk I will provide a gentle introduction to topoi. I will give several examples and walk through the basic properties that topoi possess which ensure they contain models of first order theories.
