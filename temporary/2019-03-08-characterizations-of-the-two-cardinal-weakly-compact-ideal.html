abstract: "<p>
Sun proved that, assuming $&#92;kappa$ is a weakly compact cardinal, a subset $W&#92;subseteq&#92;kappa$ is $&#92;Pi^1_1$-indescribable (or equivalently weakly compact) if and only if $W&#92;cap C&#92;neq&#92;emptyset$ for every $1$-club $C&#92;subseteq &#92;kappa$; here, a set $C&#92;subseteq&#92;kappa$ is <em>$1$-club</em> if and only if $C&#92;in&#92;textrm{NS}_&#92;kappa^+$ and whenever $&#92;alpha<&#92;kappa$ is inaccessible and $C&#92;cap &#92;alpha&#92;in&#92;textrm{NS}_&#92;alpha^+$ then $&#92;alpha&#92;in C$. We generalize Sun's characterization to $&#92;Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $P_&#92;kappa&#92;lambda$, which were first defined by Baumgartner by using a natural two-cardinal version of the cumulative hierarchy. Using the minimal <em>strongly</em> normal ideal of <em>non-strongly stationary sets</em> on $P_&#92;kappa&#92;lambda$, which is distinct from $&#92;textrm{NS}_{&#92;kappa,&#92;lambda}$ when $&#92;kappa$ is inaccessible, we formulate a notion of $1$-club subset of $P_&#92;kappa&#92;lambda$ and prove that a set $W&#92;subseteq P_&#92;kappa&#92;lambda$ is $&#92;Pi^1_1$-indescribable if and only if $W&#92;cap C&#92;neq&#92;emptyset$ for every $1$-club $C&#92;subseteq P_&#92;kappa&#92;lambda$. We also show that elementary embeddings considered by Schanker witnessing <em>near supercompactness</em> lead to the definition of a normal ideal on $P_&#92;kappa&#92;lambda$, and indeed, this ideal is equal to Baumgartner's ideal of non-$&#92;Pi^1_1$-indescribable subsets of $P_&#92;kappa&#92;lambda$. Additionally, we will discuss an application which answers a question of Cox-L&uuml;cke.
