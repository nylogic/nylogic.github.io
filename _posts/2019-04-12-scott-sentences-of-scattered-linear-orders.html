abstract: "<p>
The logic $L_{&#92;omega_1 &#92;omega}$ is obtained by closing finitary first-order logic under countable disjunction and conjunction. There is a
kind of normal form for such sentences. For any structure there is a sentence of 
$L_{&#92;omega_1 &#92;omega}$, known as its <em>Scott sentence</em>, which describes $A$ up to isomorphism among countable structures. Given a countable scattered linear order $L$ of Hausdorff rank $&#92;alpha < &#92;omega_1$, we show that it has a $d$-$&#92;Sigma_{2 &#92;alpha+1}$ Scott sentence. From Ash's calculation of the back and forth relations for all countable well-orders, we obtain that this upper bound is tight, i.e.,  for every $&#92;alpha < &#92;omega_1$ there is a linear order whose optimal Scott sentence has this complexity.
