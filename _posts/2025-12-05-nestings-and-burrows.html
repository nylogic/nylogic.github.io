abstract: "
<p>
We try to formulate tighter definitions that are sufficient to prove the existence of models of $&#92;Pi^1_n$-Monotone Induction, and for strategies in Boolean combinations of $&#92;Pi^0_3$-games following on work of Montalbán-Shore.  This  is joint work with Juan Aguilera, and can be viewed as low-level constructibility theory together with some admissibility theory.
