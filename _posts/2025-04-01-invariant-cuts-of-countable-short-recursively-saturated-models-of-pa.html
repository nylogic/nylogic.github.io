<p>
In this talk we continue the discussion on the automorphism groups of countable short recursively saturated models of PA. In particular, we discuss the cuts of the model which are fixed setwise by all automorphisms (invariant cuts). We show that such cuts occur in different places of the model, depending on the types realized in the last gap. We then show that this implies, in some of these cases, that the automorphism groups of such models are non-isomorphic as topological groups. This is a joint work with Ermek Nurkhaidarov.
