This talk will discuss my work with Miriam Parnes and four undergraduates which took place last summer at an REU at Towson University.  We say that a class of structures in some fixed language is indivisible if, for all structures A in the class and number of colors k, there is a structure B in the class such that, no matter how we color B with k colors, there is a monochromatic copy of A in B.  Parnes and I became interested in this property when studying the classification of theories via positive combinatorial configurations.  In this talk, following the work with our students, I will examine indivisibility on classes of graphs.  In particular, we will look at hereditarily sparse graphs, cographs, perfect graphs, threshold graphs, and a few other classes.  <i>This work is joint with Felix Nusbaum, Zain Padamsee, Miriam Parnes, Christian Pippin, and Ava Zinman</i>.
