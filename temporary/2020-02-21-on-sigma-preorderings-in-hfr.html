abstract: "We prove that $&#92;omega_1$ cannot be embedded into any preordering $&#92;Sigma$-definable with parameters in the hereditarily finite superstructure over the ordered field of real numbers, HF(R).
As corollaries, we obtain characterizations of $&#92;Sigma$-presentable ordinals and GÃ¶del constructive sets of kind $L_&#92;alpha$.
It also follows that there are no $&#92;Sigma$-presentations for structures of $T$-, $m$-, $1$-, and $tt$-degrees over HF(R). "
