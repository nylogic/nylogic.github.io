<p>We prove that any two countable models of the theory ${&#92;rm WKL}^*_0$ sharing the same first-order universe and containing the same counterexample to $&#92;Sigma^0_1$ induction are isomorphic.</p>
<p>
This theorem implies that over ${&#92;rm WKL}^*_0 + &#92;neg I&#92;Sigma^0_1$, the analytic hierarchy collapses to the arithmetic hierarchy. It also implies that ${&#92;rm WKL}^*_0$ is the strongest $&#92;Pi^1_2$ statement that is $&#92;Pi^1_1$-conservative over ${&#92;rm RCA}^*_0 + &#92;neg I&#92;Sigma^0_1$. Together with the (slightly subtle) generalizations of the theorem to higher levels of the arithmetic hierarchy, this gives an 'almost negative' answer to a question of Towsner, who asked whether $&#92;Pi^1_1$-conservativity of $&#92;Pi^1_2$ sentences over collection principles is a $&#92;Pi^0_2$-complete computational problem. Our results also have some implications for the reverse mathematics of combinatorial principles&#58; for instance, we get a specific $&#92;Pi^1_1$ sentence that is provable in ${&#92;rm RCA}_0 + B&#92;Sigma^0_2$ exactly if the $&#92;Pi^1_1$ consequences of ${&#92;rm RCA}_0 + {&#92;rm RT}^2_2$ coincide with $B&#92;Sigma^0_2$.</p>
<p>
On the side, we also give a positive answer to Towsner's question as originally stated.</p>
