abstract: "<p>There is a well-known close logical connection between PA and
finite set theory. Is there a set theory that corresponds in an
analogous way to bounded arithmetic $I&#92;Delta_0$? I propose a candidate
for such a theory, called $I&#92;Delta_0S$, and consider the questions: what
set-theoretic axioms can it prove? And given a model M of $I&#92;Delta_0$ is
there a model of $I&#92;Delta_0S$ whose ordinals are isomorphic to M? The
answer is yes if M is a model of Exp; to obtain the answer we use a new
way of coding sets by numbers.</p>
