abstract: "<p>
The use of nonstandard models *N of the natural numbers
has recently found several applications in arithmetic Ramsey theory.
The basic observation is that every infinite number in *N corresponds
to an ultrafilter on N, and the algebra of ultrafilters is a really powerful
tool in this field. Note that this notion also makes sense in any
model of PA, where one can consider the 1-type of any infinite number.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, nonstandard natural numbers are endowed with a natural compact topology, and one can apply the methods of topological dynamics considering the shift operator $x &#92;mapsto x+1$ . This very peculiar dynamic has interesting characteristics.</p>
<p>
In this talk I will also present a new result in the style of Hindman’s Theorem
about the existence of infinite monochromatic configurations in any finite coloring of the natural numbers. A typical example is the following monochromatic pattern:<br>
a, b, c, $&#92;ldots$ , a+b+ab, a+c+ac, b+c+bc, $&#92;ldots$ , a+b+c+ab+ac+bc+abc.</p>
