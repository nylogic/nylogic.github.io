<p>
The model theory of fields with automorphisms began with ACFA, where
the field has one named automorphism or, equivalently, a named action
by the group $(&#92;mathbb{Z}, +)$. Some other groups acting on fields also produce
nice theories: free groups, finite groups, subgroups of $(&#92;mathbb{Q},
+)$. Some, such as free abelian groups on two or more generators, do
not. This talk will survey these results.
