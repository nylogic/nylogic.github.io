One could make the claim that category theory is as  foundational as set-theory or model-theory. So, we should be able to transfer from one perspective to the other. In this talk, I will consider one aspect of this meta-equivalence, by introducing a theory  in a very simple, one-sorted(!) language, whose models are  all  categories admitting a terminal object (many categories do). Many categorical constructions  then turn out to be first-order. But something even more strange  happens: standard categories (like the category of Abelian groups) become actually universal models! I'll explain this apparent contradiction. </p>
<p>
In the second part of the talk, I will concentrate on one particularly interesting category: that of compact Hausdorff spaces. I will show that we can recover the natural numbers $N$ and the reals $R$, or rather, (the isomorphism classes of) their compactifications $&#92;bar N$ and $&#92;bar R$,  by parameter-free definitions, including their order relation,   addition and   multiplication. Moreover, in any category  that is elementary equivalent to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the resulting objects are then a model of PA and a real closed field respectively. Full disclosure: while I have a complete proof for the first assertion, the second is still conjectural.</p>
<p>
Apart from some basic model-theory, category theory and topology, everything else will be explained in the talk and so it should be accessible to many.
