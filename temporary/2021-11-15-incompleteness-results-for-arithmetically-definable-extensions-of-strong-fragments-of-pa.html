<p>
In this talk, I will present generalisations of some incompleteness results along two
axes: r.e. theories are replaced by $&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$-definable ones, and the base theory is pushed
down as far as it will go below PA. Such results are often easy to prove from suitably
formulated generalisations of facts used in the original proofs. I will present a handful
of such facts, including versions of the arithmetised completeness theorem and the Orey–Hájek
characterisation, to show what additional assumptions our theories must satisfy for the
results to generalise. Two salient classes of theories emerge in this context:
(a) $&#92;Sigma_n$-sound extensions of I$&#92;Sigma_n$ + exp, and (b) $&#92;Pi_n$-complete, consistent extensions of I$&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$.
Finally, I will discuss some results that fail to generalise to $&#92;Sigma_{n+1}$-definable theories,
as well as an open problem related to Woodin's theorem on the universal algorithm.
