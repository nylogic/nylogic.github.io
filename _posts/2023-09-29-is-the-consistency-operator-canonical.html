<p>
It is a well-known empirical phenomenon that natural axiomatic theories are well-ordered by consistency strength. The restriction to natural theories is necessary; using ad-hoc techniques (such as self-reference and Rosser orderings) one can exhibit non-linearity and ill-foundedness in the consistency strength hierarchy. What explains the contrast between natural theories and axiomatic theories in general?
</p><p>
Our approach to this problem is inspired by work on an analogous problem in recursion theory. The natural Turing degrees $(0,0’,&#92;ldots,&#92;text{Kleene’s~}&#92;mathcal{O},&#92;ldots,0^{&#92;#},&#92;ldots)$ are well-ordered by Turing reducibility, yet the Turing degrees in general are neither linearly ordered nor well-founded, as ad-hoc techniques (such as the priority method) bear out. Martin's Conjecture, which is still unresolved, is a proposed explanation for this phenomenon. In particular, Martin’s Conjecture specifies a way in which the Turing jump is canonical.
</p><p>
After discussing Martin’s Conjecture, we will formulate analogous proof-theoretic hypotheses according to which the consistency operator is canonical. We will then discuss results - both positive and negative - within this framework. Some of these results were obtained jointly with Antonio Montalbán.
