abstract: "<p>
In 1989, Stuart Smith proved that for every full truth predicate T on a nonstandard model M of PA, there is a nonstandard formula that, according to T, defines an undefinable class of M. Recently, Bartosz Wcis≈Ço improved this by showing that there is also a nonstandard formula that defines an inductive partial truth predicate. The  proof uses the technique of disjunctions with stopping conditions. I will discuss the proof, and, if time permits, I will also talk about the end extension problem for full truth predicates.
