abstract: "A first-order theory is n-dependent if the edge relation of an infinite generic (n+1)-hypergraph is not definable in any of its models. N-dependence is a strict hierarchy increasing with n, with 1-dependence corresponding to the well-studied class of NIP theories. I will discuss recent joint work with Nadja Hempel on trying to understand which algebraic structures are n-dependent."
