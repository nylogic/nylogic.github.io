<p>
In this talk  we discuss   automorphisms of countable short recursively saturated models of PA. </p>
<p>
Kossak-Schmerl 95 shows that: if M is a countable, arithmetically saturated model of PA, then the automorphism group of M codes its standard system. We discuss how to prove a similar result for countable short arithmetically saturated models of PA. </p>
<p>
This is joint work with Erez Shochat.
