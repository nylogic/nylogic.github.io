abstract: "<p>
There has been some interest recently in nonamalgamability phenomena between countable models of set theory, and forcing extensions of a fixed model in particular. Nonamalgamability is typically achieved by coding some forbidden object between a collection of models in such a way that each model on its own remains oblivious, but some combination of them can recover the forbidden information. </p>

<p>In this talk we will examine the problem of coding arbitrary information into a generic filter, focusing on two particular examples. First, I will present some results of joint work with Jonathan Verner where we consider surgical modifications to Cohen reals and sets of indices where such modifications are always possible. Later, I will discuss a recent result of S. Friedman and Hathaway where they achieve, using different coding, nonamalgamability between arbitrary countable models of set theory of the same height.
