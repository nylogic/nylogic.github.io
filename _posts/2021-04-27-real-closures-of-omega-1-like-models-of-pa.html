<p>D'Aquino, Knight and Starchenko showed the real closure of a model of Peano Arithmetic is recursively saturated.  Thus any two countable models of PA with the same standard system have isomorphic real closures.
Charlie Steinhorn, Jim Schmerl and I showed that even for $&#92;omega_1$-like model of PA the situation is very different.
We construct $2^{&#92;aleph_1}$ recursively saturated elementarily equivalent $&#92;omega_1$-like models of PA with the same standard system and non-isomorphic real closures.
