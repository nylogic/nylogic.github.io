abstract: "Over the last several decades a robust theory of 'tame' expansions of the real field has been developed.  Typically tameness in manifested in such situations by the definable sets having some particularly simple topological type.  In this talk I will consider how this machinery can be adapted to expansions of Presburger arithmetic in which such topological considerations are largely irrelevant.  This is joint work with Chris Miller."
