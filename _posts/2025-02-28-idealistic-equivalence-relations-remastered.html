<p>
In recent work with Luca Motto Ros we prove that under analytic determinacy there exists an analytic relation that is not class-wise Borel embeddable into any orbit equivalence relation. The result builds on an unpublished result of Becker from 2001 and fits in the area of invariant descriptive set theory. I will mainly discuss our result and how it is related to a major conjecture in the field known as the '$E_1$ conjecture'.
