abstract: "
<p>We classify intermediate models of Magidor-Radin generic extensions. It turns out that similar to Gitik Kanovei and Koepke's result, every such intermediate model is of the form $V[C]$ where $C$ is a subsequence of the generic club added by the forcing. The proof uses the Galvin property for normal filters to prove that quotients of some Prikry-type forcings are $&#92;kappa^+$-c.c. in the generic extension and therefore do not add fresh subsets to $&#92;kappa^+$. If time permits, we will also present results regarding intermediate models of the Tree-Prikry forcing.</p>
