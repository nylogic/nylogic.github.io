<p>
I will begin with an overview of how implicit definition, and variations
of Beth's definability theorem, arise in relational databases,
particularly in the context of view rewriting.
</p><p>
We then turn from relational databases to nested relational databases,
a model of hierarchical data - 'objects' -  where tables can contain
tuples whose components are again tables. There is a standard
transformation language for this data model, the Nested Relational
Calculus (NRC). We show that a variant of Gaifman's coordinatization
theorem plays a role in lieu of Beth's theorem, allowing one to
generate NRC transformations from several kinds of implicit
specifications. We discuss how to generate transformations effectively
from specifications, which requires the development of proof-theoretic
methods for implicit definability over nested sets.
</p><p>
This is joint work with Ceclia Pradic and Christoph Wernhard.
