abstract: "

<p>The Triangular Embedding Theorem gives a sort of internal generic absoluteness principle that holds under determinacy or large-cardinal assumptions. It originated in work (joint with Itay Neeman) on mad families and the Ramsey Property under AD^+. I will discuss these origins, some applications, and some questions.</p>
