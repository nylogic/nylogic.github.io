<p>
This talk, in the Mathematics Department Colloquium of the CUNY Graduate Center, will be aimed at a broad mathematical audience.<br>
Traditionally, computability theory has been restricted to countable structures (such as groups or rings).  We explain how digital computation by Turing machines can be applied to continuum-sized structures, with particular attention to the real numbers and the absolute Galois group of the rationals, and present some natural and intriguing questions regarding each.
