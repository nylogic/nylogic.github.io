<p>
Associated to certain valued differential fields like transseries and
Hardy fields are so-called asymptotic couples, which were introduced by
M. Rosenlicht. These are ordered abelian groups equipped with a map
induced by the derivation of the valued differential field. I will
describe ongoing work with A. Gehret and E. Kaplan on the asymptotic
couple of the field of logarithmic transseries, in which we show various
notions of smallness coincide. For example, the structure is d-minimal
in the sense that every unary definable set with empty interior is a
finite union of discrete sets. This enables us to classify all dimension
functions on the structure.
