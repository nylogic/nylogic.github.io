<p>
Expansions of the ordered additive group of the reals (or more generally definably complete expansions of ordered Abelian groups) of finite dp-rank are a class of reasonably well-behaved ordered structures that generalize the class of o-minimal structures.  In this talk I will give a survey of ongoing work with John Goodrick on exploring the properties of definable sets in this class of structures.
