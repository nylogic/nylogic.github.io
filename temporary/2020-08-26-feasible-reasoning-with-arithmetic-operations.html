<p>
In bounded arithmetic, we study weak fragments of arithmetic that
often correspond in a certain sense to computational complexity
classes (e.g., polynomial time). Questions about provability in such
theories can be thought of as a form of <em>feasible reasoning</em>:
considering a natural object of interest from a complexity class $C$,
can we prove its fundamental properties using only concepts from $C$?</p>
<p>
Our objects of interest in this talk will be the elementary integer
arithmetic operations $+,-,&#92;times,/$, whose complexity class is
(uniform) $&#92;mathrm{TC}^0$, a small subclass of $&#92;mathrm{P}$. The
corresponding arithmetical theory is $&#92;mathit{VTC}^0$. Since we do not
know yet if the theory can prove the totality of division and iterated
multiplication $&#92;prod_{i&lt;n}X_i$ which are in $&#92;mathrm{TC}^0$ by an
intricate result of Hesse, Allender, and Barrington, we will also
consider an extension of the theory $&#92;mathit{VTC}^0+&#92;mathit{IMUL}$.</p>

<p>Our main question is what can $&#92;mathit{VTC}^0&#92;pm&#92;mathit{IMUL}$ prove
about the elementary arithmetic operations. The answer is that more
than one might expect: $&#92;mathit{VTC}^0+&#92;mathit{IMUL}$ proves induction
for quantifier-free formulas in the basic language of arithmetic
($&#92;mathit{IOpen}$), and even induction and minimization for
$&#92;Sigma^b_0$ (sharply bounded) formulas in Buss’s language. This
result is connected to the existence of $&#92;mathrm{TC}^0$
constant-degree root-finding algorithms; the proof relies on a
formalization of a form of the Lagrange inversion formula in
$&#92;mathit{VTC}^0+&#92;mathit{IMUL}$, and on model-theoretic abstract
nonsense involving valued fields.</p>
<p>
The remaining problem is if $&#92;mathit{VTC}^0$ proves $&#92;mathit{IMUL}$.
We will discuss issues with formalization of the
Hesse–Allender–Barrington construction in $&#92;mathit{VTC}^0$, and some
partial results (this is a work in progress).</p>
