abstract: "<p>
The axiom of disjunctive correctness (DC) asserts that the truth predicate commutes with disjunctions of arbitrary size in the sense of PA. In this talk we follow an unpublished paper of Enayat and Pakhomov discussing the strength of the theory CT^{-}(PA)+DC, and in particular showing that it implies Con(PA).
