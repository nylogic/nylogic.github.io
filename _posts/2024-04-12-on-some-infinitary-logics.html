Lindstrom Theorem characterizes first order logic as the maximal logic satisfying the Compactness Theorem and the downward Lowenheim-Skolem Theorem. 
Despite intensive efforts, no such model theoretic characterizations were obtained for infinitary logics, until Shelah introduced his logic $L^1_&#92;kappa$. We define a new class of logics $L^1_{&#92;kappa,&#92;alpha}$ generalizing Shelah's logic and examine their expressive power. If $&#92;kappa$ is a fixed point of the $&#92;beth$-function these logics coincide with $L^1_&#92;kappa$. We given a different version of Lindstrom's theorem in terms of the $&#92;phi$-submodel relation. </p><p>
We also discuss algebraic characterization of the elementary equivalence relation for these logics for suitable $&#92;kappa$.
