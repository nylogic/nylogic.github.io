<p>
Following up on the series of talks on the history of the problem, in this talk we will discuss the main technique for realizing finite lattices as interstructure lattices, due to Schmerl in 1986. We will motivate this technique by studying an example: the Boolean algebra $&#92;mathsf{B}_2$. We will see how we can modify the technique to produce elementary extensions realizing specific ranked lattices to ensure that such extensions are end, cofinal, or mixed extensions.
