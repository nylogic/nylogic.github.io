abstract: "<p>
Generic elementary embeddings have many applications throughout set theory. For example, Solovay's original proof that every stationary subset of a regular uncountable cardinal $&#92;kappa$ can be partitioned into $&#92;kappa$ disjoint stationary sets involves the use of a generic ultrapower embedding obtained by forcing with the nonstationary ideal. The generic ultrapower construction leads naturally to a characterization of the nonstationary ideal on a regular uncountable cardinal $&#92;textrm{NS}_&#92;kappa$ in terms of generic elementary embeddings. We will show that this characterization can be generalized to various ideals associated to large cardinals. Specifically, we will discuss characterizations of the $&#92;Pi^m_n$-indescribability ideals, the subtle ideal and the ineffability ideal in terms of generic elementary embeddings as well as potential applications.
