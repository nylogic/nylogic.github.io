Ali Enayat had asked whether there is a model of Peano arithmetic (PA) that can be represented as $&#92;langle&#92;mathbb Q,&#92;oplus,&#92;otimes&#92;rangle$, where $&#92;oplus$ and $&#92;otimes$ are continuous functions on the rationals $&#92;mathbb Q$. We prove, affirmatively, that indeed every countable model of PA has such a continuous presentation on the rationals. More generally, we investigate the topological spaces that arise as such topological models of arithmetic. The reals $&#92;mathbb{R}$, the reals in any finite dimension $&#92;mathbb{R}^n$, the long line and the Cantor space do not, and neither does any Suslin line; many other spaces do; the status of the Baire space is open.</p>
<p>This is joint work with Ali Enayat, myself and Bartosz Wcisło.</p>
