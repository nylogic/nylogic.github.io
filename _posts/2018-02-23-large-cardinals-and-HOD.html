abstract: "<p>In his work on the HOD conjecture, Woodin isolates the concept of of an inner model $N$ being a <em>weak extender model for $&#92;delta$ is supercompact</em>: $N$ is an inner model of ZFC, and for every $&#92;gamma>&#92;delta$, there is a $&#92;delta$-complete normal fine measure $U$ on $P_&#92;delta(&#92;gamma)$ such that $N&#92;cap P_&#92;delta(&#92;gamma)&#92;in U$ and $U&#92;cap N&#92;in N$. In the case of HOD, when it is a weak extender model for $&#92;delta$ is supercompact that implies that $&#92;delta$ is HOD-supercompact. In this talk I will separate the concepts of supercompactness, supercompactness in HOD and being HOD-supercompact and how these concepts will be affected by the assumption of the HOD hypothesis.</p> <p>This is joint work with Arthur Apter and Gunter Fuchs.</p>"
