<p>
Compared with end extensions, much little is known about cofinal extensions for models of fragments of PA, especially their elementarity. In this talk, I will try to give a complete characterization of the elementarity of cofinal extensions. I will present a systematic way to `compress' the truth of M into the second-order structure of a definable cut, and as a consequence, a correspondence theorem between the first-order theory of M and the second-order theory of the cut. Through this method I will construct several models with special cofinal extension properties. I will also show that every countable model of arithmetic fail to satisfy PA admits a non-elementary cofinal extension. It provides a model-theoretic characterization for PA in terms of cofinal extensions.
