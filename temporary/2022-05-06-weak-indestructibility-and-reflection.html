abstract: "
<p>Assuming multiple of strong cardinals, there are lots of cardinals with small degrees of strength (i.e. $&#92;kappa$ that are $&#92;kappa$+2-strong).  We can calculate the consistency strength of these all cardinal's small degrees of strength being weakly indestructible using forcing and core model techniques in a way similar to Apter and Sargsyan's previous work.  This yields some easy relations between indestructibility and Woodin cardinals, and also generalizes easily to supercompacts.  I will give a proof sketches of these results.</p>
