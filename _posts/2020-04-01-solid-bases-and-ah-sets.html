abstract: "When $A &#92;subseteq &#92;mathcal{M} &#92;vDash PA^{&#92;ast}$, we say that $A$ is a <em>basis</em> for $&#92;mathcal{M}$ if for all $X &#92;subseteq A$, the submodel $M_{X}$ generated by $X$ is the unique $&#92;mathcal{N} &#92;prec &#92;mathcal{M}$ such that $X = &#92;mathcal{N} &#92;cap A$, and that such $A$ is <em>solid</em> if for all finite $X,Y &#92;subseteq A$, whenever $f: &#92;mathcal{M}_{X} &#92;to &#92;mathcal{M}_{Y}$ is an isomorphism, then $f &#92;upharpoonright_{X}$ is one-to-one onto $Y$. We will discuss what role a solid basis can play in controlling the amount of indiscernibility and the automorphisms of a model. Also, using a set of types called an 'AH-set', we will construct a solid basis. "
