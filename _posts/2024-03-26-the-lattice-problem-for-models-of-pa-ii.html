<p>
The lattice problem for models of PA is to determine which lattices can
be represented either as lattices of elementary  substructures of a model of PA or,
more generally, which can be represented as lattices of elementary substructures
of a model N that contain a given elementary substructure M of N.  I will talk about
the history of the problem, from the seminal paper of Haim Gaifman from 1976 and
other early results to some recent work of Jim Schmerl. There is much to talk about.
