<p>
It was shown by Visser that Peano Arithmetic has the property that no two distinct extensions of it (in its language) are bi-interpretable. Enayat proposed to refer to this property of a theory as <em>tightness</em> and to carry out a more systematic study of tightness and its stronger variants, which he called <em>neatness</em> and <em>solidity</em>.
</p><p>
Enayat proved that not only $&#92;text{PA}$, but also $&#92;text{ZF}$, $&#92;text{Z}_{2}$, and $&#92;text{KM}$ are solid; and on the other hand, that finitely axiomatisable fragments of them are not even tight. Later work by a number of authors showed that many natural proper fragments of these theories are also not tight.
</p><p>
Enayat asked whether there are proper solid subtheories (containing some basic axioms that depend on the theory) of the theories listed above. We answer this question in the case of $&#92;text{PA}$ by proving that for every $n$ there exists a solid theory strictly between $&#92;text{I}&#92;Sigma_{n}$ and $&#92;text{PA}$. Furthermore, we can require that the theory does not interpret $&#92;text{PA}$, and that if any true arithmetic sentence is added to it, the theory still does not prove $&#92;text{PA}$.
