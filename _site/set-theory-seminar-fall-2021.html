						<div style="display:none" id="2">
							 <p> Many sets of reals - well orders of the reals, MAD families, ultrafilters on omega etc - only necessarily exist under the axiom of choice. As such, it has been a perennial topic in descriptive set theory to try to understand when, if ever, such sets can be of low definitional complexity. Large cardinals rule out such the existence of projective well orders, MAD families etc while it's known that if $V=L$ (or even just 'every real is constructible') then there is a $&#92;Delta^1_2$ well order of the reals and $&#92;Pi^1_1$ witnesses to many other extremal sets of reals such as MAD families and ultrafilter bases. Recently a lot of work on the border of combinatorial and descriptive set theory has focused on considering what happens to the definitional complexity of such sets in models in which the reals have a richer structure - for instance when $&#92;mathsf{CH}$ fails and various inequalities between cardinal characteristics is achieved. In this talk I will present a recent advance in this area by exhibiting a model where the continuum is $&#92;aleph_2$, there is a $&#92;Delta^1_3$ well order of the reals, and a $&#92;Pi^1_1$ MAD family, a $&#92;Pi^1_1$ ultrafilter base for a P-point, and a $&#92;Pi^1_1$ maximal independent family, all of size $&#92;aleph_1$. These complexities are best possible for both the type of object and the cardinality hence this may be seen as a maximal model of 'minimal complexity witnesses'. This is joint work with Jeffrey Bergfalk and Vera Fischer. </p> <p> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPf_q9g2PFM'><strong>Video</strong></a> </p>

							 <p> Set-theoretic potentialism is the view that the universe of sets is never fully completed but is only given potentially. Tools from modal logic have been applied to understand the mathematics of potentialism. In recent work, Neil Barton and I extended this analysis to class-theoretic potentialism, the view that proper classes are given potentially (while the sets may or may not be fixed). </p><p> In this talk, I will survey some results from set-theoretic potentialism. After seeing how the tools apply in that context I will then discuss our work in the class-theoretic context. </p> <p> <a href=''><strong>Video</strong></a> </p>

							 <p> Let $n>1$ be a natural number, let $&#92;Gamma_n$ be the hypergraph of isosceles triangles in $&#92;mathbb{R}^n$. Under the axiom of choice, the existence of a countable coloring for $&#92;Gamma_n$ is true for every $n$. Without the axiom of choice, the coloring problems will be hard to answer. We often expect the case that the countable chromatic number of one hypergraph doesn't imply the one for another. With an inaccessible cardinal, there is a model of ZF+DC in which $&#92;Gamma_2$ has countable chromatic number while $&#92;Gamma_3$ has uncountable chromatic number. This result is obtained by a balanced forcing over the symmetric Solovay model.

						<div style="display:none" id="7">
							 <p> By beginning with the order topology on an ordinal $&#92;delta$, and iteratively declaring more and more derived sets to be open, Bagaria defined the derived topologies $&#92;tau_&#92;xi$ on $&#92;delta$, where $&#92;xi$ is an ordinal. He showed that the non-isolated points in the space $(&#92;delta,&#92;tau_&#92;xi)$ can be characterized using a strong form of iterated simultaneous stationary reflection called $&#92;xi$-s-reflection, which is deeply connected to certain transfinite indescribability properties. However, Bagaria's definitions break for $&#92;xi&#92;geq&#92;delta$ because, under his definitions, the $&#92;delta$-th derived topology $&#92;tau_&#92;delta$ is discrete and no ordinal $&#92;alpha$ can be $&#92;alpha+1$-s-stationary. We will discuss some new work in which we use certain diagonal versions of Bagaria's definitions to extend his results. For example, we introduce the notions of diagonal Cantor derivative and use it to obtain a sequence of derived topologies on a regular $&#92;delta$ that is strictly longer than that of Bagaria's, under certain hypotheses. </p> <p> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umBKkYhRKFc'><strong>Video</strong></a> </p>

We also show that (assuming large cardinals) forcibility overlaps with the apparently weaker notion of consistency for any mathematical problem $&#92;psi$ expressible as a $&#92;Pi_2$-sentence of a (very large fragment of) third order arithmetic ($&#92;mathsf{CH}$, the Suslin hypothesis, the Whitehead conjecture for free groups are a small sample of such problems $&#92;psi$). Partial Morleyizations can be described as follows: let $&#92;mathsf{Form}_{&#92;tau}$ be the set of first order $&#92;tau$-formulae; for $A&#92;subseteq &#92;mathsf{Form}_&#92;tau$, $&#92;tau_A$ is the expansion of $&#92;tau$ adding atomic relation symbols $R_&#92;phi$ for all formulae $&#92;phi$ in $A$ and $T_{&#92;tau,A}$ is the $&#92;tau_A$-theory asserting that each $&#92;tau$-formula $&#92;phi(&#92;vec{x})&#92;in A$ is logically equivalent to the corresponding atomic formula $R_&#92;phi(&#92;vec{x})$. For a $&#92;tau$-theory $T$ $T+T_{&#92;tau,A}$ is the <em>partial Morleyization</em> of $T$ induced by $A&#92;subseteq &#92;mathsf{Form}_&#92;tau$. </p> <p> <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54rpJd4T2ig'><strong>Video</strong></a> </p>

						<div style="display:none" id="10">
							 <p>We shall present some recent results from a joint work with Philipp Lücke on Structural Reflection at the upper ridges of the large-cardinal hierarchy. In particular, we will introduce a natural form of reflection we call 'Exact Reflection', giving upper and lower bounds for its consistency strength. We will also discuss 'sequential' forms of Exact Reflection, which may be viewed as strong forms of Chang's Conjecture, and which, in the case of infinite sequences, their strength goes beyond the strongest large cardinal principles that are not known to be inconsistent with the Axiom of Choice.</p>
