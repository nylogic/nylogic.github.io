Recall that if $M &#92;subseteq N$ are models of set theory then $N$ end-extends $M$ if $N$ does not have new elements for sets in $M$. In this talk I will discuss a $&#92;Sigma_1$-definable finite sequence which is universal for end extensions in the following sense. Consider a computably axiomatizable extension $&#92;overline{&#92;mathsf{ZF}}$ of $&#92;mathsf{ZF}$. There is a $&#92;Sigma_1$-definable finite sequence

$$a_0, a_1, &#92;ldots, a_n$$

with the following properties.</p>
<p>
* $&#92;mathsf{ZF}$ proves that the sequence is finite.<br>

* In any transitive model of $&#92;overline{&#92;mathsf{ZF}}$ the sequence is empty.<br>

* If $M$ is a countable model of $&#92;overline{&#92;mathsf{ZF}}$ in which the sequence is $s$ and $t &#92;in M$ is a finite sequence extending $s$ then there is an end-extension $N &#92;models &#92;overline{&#92;mathsf{ZF}}$ of $M$ in which the sequence is exactly $t$.<br>

* Indeed,  for the previous statements it suffices that $M &#92;models &#92;mathsf{ZF}$ and end-extends a submodel $W &#92;models &#92;overline{&#92;mathsf{ZF}}$ of height at least $(&#92;omega_1^{&#92;mathrm{L}})^M$.<br></p>
<p>
This universal finite sequence can be used to determine the modal validities of end-extensional set-theoretic potentialism, namely to be exactly the modal theory $&#92;mathsf{S4}$. The sequence can also be used to show that every countable model of set theory extends to a model satisfying the end-extensional maximality principle, asserting that any possibly necessary sentence is already true.</p>
<p>
This talk is about joint work with Joel David Hamkins. The $&#92;Sigma_1$ universal finite sequence is a sister to the $&#92;Sigma_2$ universal finite sequence for rank-extensions of Hamkins and Woodin, and both are cousins of Woodin's universal algorithm for arithmetic.</p>
