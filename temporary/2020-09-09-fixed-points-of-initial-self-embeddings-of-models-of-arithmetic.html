abstract: "
<p>In 1973, Harvey Friedman proved his striking result on <em>initial self-embeddings</em> of countable nonstandard models of set theory and Peano arithmetic. In this talk, I will discuss my joint work with Ali Enayat focused on the fixed point set of initial self-embeddings of countable nonstandard models of arithmetic. Especially, I will survey the proof of some generalizations of well-known results on the fixed point set of automorphisms of countable recursively saturated models of $ &#92;mathrm{PA} $, to results about the fixed point set of initial self-embeddings of countable nonstandard models of $ &#92;mathrm{I}&#92;Sigma_{1} $.</p>
