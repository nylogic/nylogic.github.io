abstract: "<p>If $&#92;kappa$ is measurable and GCH holds, then any ultrapower by a normal measure on $&#92;kappa$ will be missing some subset of $&#92;kappa^+$. On the other hand, Cummings showed that, starting from a $(&#92;kappa+2)$-strong $&#92;kappa$, one can force to a model where $&#92;kappa$ carries a normal measure whose ultrapower captures the entire powerset of $&#92;kappa^+$. Moreover, the large cardinal hypothesis is optimal. I will present an improvement of Cummings' result and show that this capturing property can consistently hold at the least measurable cardinal.</p>
