abstract: "
<p>
Parameters are free variables in various axiom schemata in
PA, ZFC, and other similar theories.
Given an axiom schema S, we let S* be the parameter-free
sub-schema.
</p><p>
Kreisel (A survey of proof theory, JSL 1968) was one of
those who paid attention
to the comparison of some schemata in second-order PA and
their parameter-free versions.
In particular, Kreisel noted that
<p></p>
[...]
if one is convinced of the significance of something like
a given axiom schema,
it is natural to study details, such as the effect of
parameters.
</p><p>
This talk is devoted to the effect of parameters in the
schemata of Comprehension
and Choice in second-order arithmetic.</p>
