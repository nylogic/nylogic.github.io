abstract: "Any ultrapower $M$ of the universe by a normal measure on a cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is quite far from $V$ in the sense that it computes $V_{&#92;kappa+2}$ incorrectly. If GCH holds, this amounts to saying that $M$ is missing a subset of $&#92;kappa^+$. Steel asked whether, even in the absence of GCH, normal ultrapowers at $&#92;kappa$ must miss a subset of $&#92;kappa^+$. In the early 90s Cummings gave a negative answer, building a model with a normal measure on $&#92;kappa$ whose ultrapower captures the entire powerset of $&#92;kappa^+$. I will present some joint work with Radek Honzík in which we improved Cummings’ result to get this capturing property to hold at the least measurable cardinal.
