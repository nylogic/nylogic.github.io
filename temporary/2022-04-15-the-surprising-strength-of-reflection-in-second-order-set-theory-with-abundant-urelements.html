abstract: "
<p>I shall give a general introduction to urelement set theory and the role of the second-order reflection principle in second-order urelement set theory GBCU and KMU. With the abundant atom axiom, asserting that the class of urelements greatly exceeds the class of pure sets, the second-order reflection principle implies the existence of a supercompact cardinal in an interpreted model of ZFC. The proof uses a reflection characterization of supercompactness: a cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is supercompact if and only if for every second-order sentence  true in some structure $M$ (of any size) is also true in a first-order elementary substructure $m&#92;prec M$ of size less than $&#92;kappa$. This is joint work with Bokai Yao. <a href='http://jdh.hamkins.org/surprising-strength-of-reflection-with-abundant-urelements-cuny-set-theory-seminar-april-2022/'>http://jdh.hamkins.org/surprising-strength-of-reflection-with-abundant-urelements-cuny-set-theory-seminar-april-2022</a> </p>
