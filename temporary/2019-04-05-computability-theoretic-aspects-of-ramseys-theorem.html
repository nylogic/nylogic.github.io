abstract: "<p>
Ramsey's Theorem for pairs and 2 colors says that for every 2-coloring, $C$, of pairs of natural numbers, there is an infinite set $H$, such that all pairs from $H$ have the same constant color.  $H$ is called a <em>homogeneous</em> set for $C$.  We will also consider Ramsey's Theorem in other settings.  For example, we can be given countably many $1$-colorings of natural numbers, $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$, and ask for a set $C$ such that, for each $i$, all but finitely many elements of $C$ have the same color with respect to $c_i$.  Call $C$ a <em>cohesive</em> set for $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$.

Among the questions we will explore here is what can be computed from homogeneous sets.  For example, given countably many $1$-colorings $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$, is there a 2-coloring $C$, such that every homogeneous set for $C$ computes a <em>cohesive</em> set for $&#92;{c_i&#92;}$?
