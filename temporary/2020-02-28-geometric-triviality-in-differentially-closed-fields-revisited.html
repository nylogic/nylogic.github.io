abstract: "In this talk we revisit the problem of describing the 'finer' structure of geometrically trivial strongly minimal sets in $DCF_0$. In particular, I will explain how recent work joint with Guy Casale and James Freitag on automorphic functions, has lead to intriguing questions around the $&#92;omega$-categoricity conjecture. This conjecture was disproved in its full generality by James Freitag and Tom Scanlon using the modular $j$-function. I will explain how their counter-example fits into the larger context of arithmetic automorphic functions and has allowed us to 'propose' refinements to the original conjecture."
