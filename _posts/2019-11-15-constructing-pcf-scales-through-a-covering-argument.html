abstract: "We will present a method of constructing scales on products of regular cardinals. The choice of cardinals depends on the position of 'cutpoints' in the extender sequence of the core model. Here we will only discuss the simplest case of sequences of measures.
Scale degrees will correspond to structures occurring in K that will be familiar to some from the construction of square sequences (both global and local) in fine structural inner models. The scale so constructed is canonical, short, and otherwise nice.
This work is part of a joint project with Omer Ben-Neria."
