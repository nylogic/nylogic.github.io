abstract: "I will give an exposition of a technique by Baldwin and Laskowski for extending the Henkin construction to get models of size continuum with interesting properties. The main theorem gives sufficient conditions for a theory to have a model of size continuum which is Borel, atomic and omits some given collection of countably many types. Time permitting I will sketch some applications as well."
