<p>
Given an $L_{&#92;omega_1&#92;omega}$-sentence $&#92;varphi$ in a countable language, we call an ergodic $S_&#92;infty$-invariant probability measure on the Borel space of countable models of $&#92;varphi$ (having fixed underlying set) an <em>ergodic model</em> of $&#92;varphi$. I will discuss the number of ergodic models of such a sentence $&#92;varphi$, including the case when $&#92;varphi$ is a Scott sentence. This is joint work with N. Ackerman, C. Freer, A. Kruckman and A. Kwiatkowska.
