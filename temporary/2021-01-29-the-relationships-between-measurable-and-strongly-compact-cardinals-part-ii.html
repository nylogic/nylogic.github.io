abstract: "
<p>This talk is about the ongoing investigation of the relationships between measurable and strongly compact cardinals.  I will present some of the history of the theorems in this theme, including Magidor's identity crisis, and give new results.  The theorems presented are in particular about the relationships between strongly compact cardinals and measurable cardinals of
different Mitchell orders.   One of the main theorems is that there is a universe where $&#92;kappa_1$ and $&#92;kappa_2$ are the first and second strongly compact cardinals, respectively, and where $&#92;kappa_1$ is least with Mitchell order 1, and $&#92;kappa_2$ is the least with Mitchell order 2.  Another main theorem is that there is a universe where $&#92;kappa_1$ and $&#92;kappa_2$ are the first and second strongly compact cardinals, respectively, with $&#92;kappa_1$ the least measurable cardinal such that $o(&#92;kappa_1) = 2$ and $&#92;kappa_2$ the least measurable cardinal above $&#92;kappa_1$.  This is a joint work in progress with Victoria Gitman and Arthur Apter.  </p>
