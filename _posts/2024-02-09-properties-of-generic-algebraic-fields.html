The algebraic field extensions of the rational numbers $&#92;mathbb{Q}$ – equivalently, the subfields of the algebraic closure $&#92;overline{&#92;mathbb{Q}}$ – naturally form a topological space homeomorphic to Cantor space.  Consequently, one can speak of 'large' collections of such fields, in the sense of Baire category&#58; collections that are comeager in the space.  Under a standard definition, the <em>1-generic fields</em> form a comeager set in this space.  Therefore, one may think of a property common to all 1-generic fields as a property that one might reasonably expect to be true of an arbitrarily chosen algebraic field.
</p><p>
We will present joint work with Eisenträger, Springer, and Westrick that proves several intriguing properties to be true of all 1-generic fields $F$.  First, in every such $F$, both the subring $&#92;mathbb{Z}$ of the integers and the subring $&#92;mathcal{O}_F$ of the algebraic integers of $F$ cannot be defined within $F$ by an existential formula, nor by a universal formula.  (Subsequent work by Dittman and Fehm has shown that in fact these subrings are completely undefinable in these fields.)  Next, for every presentation of every such $F$, the <em>root set</em></p>
<p align='center'>
$ R_F = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X]:p(X)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F&#92;} $
</p><p>
is always of low Turing degree relative to that presentation, but is essentially always undecidable relative to the presentation.  Moreover, the set known as <em>Hilbert's Tenth Problem for $F$</em>,</p>
<p align='center'>
$ HTP(F) = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(X_1,&#92;ldots,X_n)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F^n&#92;}, $</p>
<p>
is exactly as difficult as $R_F$, which is its restriction to single-variable polynomials.  Finally, even the question of having infinitely many solutions,</p><p>
$&#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(&#92;vec{X})=0&#92;text{ has infinitely many solutions in }F^n&#92;}, $</p>
<p>
is only as difficult as $R_F$.  These results are proven by using a forcing notion on the fields and showing that it is decidable whether or not a given condition forces a given polynomial to have a root, or to have infinitely many roots.</p>
