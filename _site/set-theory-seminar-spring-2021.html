							 <p>It is standard in set theory to assume that Cantor's Theorem establishes that the continuum is an uncountable set. A challenge for this position comes from the observation that through forcing one can collapse any cardinal to the countable and that the continuum can be made arbitrarily large. In this paper, we present a different take on the relationship between Cantor's Theorem and extensions of universes, arguing that they can be seen as showing that every set is countable and that the continuum is a proper class. We examine several theories based on maximality considerations in this framework (in particular countabilist analogues of reflection principles) and show how standard set theories (including ZFC with large cardinals added) can be incorporated. We conclude that the systems considered raise questions concerning the foundational purposes of set theory.</p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> We continue some work on L[Card] (the universe constructed from the predicate for the cardinals) to look at L[Reg] where Reg is the class of uncountable regular cardinals. The latter is also a model of a rich combinatorial structure being, as it turns out, a Magidor iteration of prikry forcings (using recent work of Ben-Neria). But it is limited in size, in fact is a rather 'thin' model.  We show, letting O^s = O^sword be the least iterable structure with a measure which concentrates on measurable cardinals:</p> <p> Theorem (ZFC) <ol type='a'> <li> Let S be a set, or proper class, of regular cardinals, then O^s is not an element of L[S].</li> <li>   (b) This is best possible, in that no smaller mouse M can be substituted for O^s.</li> <li> (c) L[S] is a model of: GCH, Square's, Diamonds, Morasses etc and has Ramsey cardinals, but no measurable cardinals.</li> </ol> </p>

							 <p>In a recent Quanta Magazine article discussing difficulties and progress related to Feynman path integrals, Charlie Wood writes, 'No known mathematical procedure can meaningfully average an infinite number of objects covering an infinite expanse of space in general.'  This statement is arguably refuted by Nonstandard Analysis, but what is perhaps lacking is a constructive approach. We present such an approach based on reduced powers and a class of algebraic structures we call comparison rings. This construction has a nice iteration theory and is able to represent classical integrals via standard parts. We discuss an example of a filter on $&#92;mathbb R^{&#92;lt&#92;omega}$, the direct limit of the $&#92;mathbb R^n$, that respects classical volumes in different dimensions simultaneously, with lower dimensional surfaces being infinitesimal relative to higher dimensional ones. This suggests a corresponding generalization of dimension, which we show under some set-theoretic assumptions may constitute a dense linear order without $(c,c)$-gaps. This is joint work with Emanuele Bottazzi. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH4nBXhjr38'>Video</a></strong></p>

<p>In his seminal work on the identity crisis of strongly compact cardinals, Magidor introduced a special iteration of Prikry forcings for a set of measurable cardinals known as the Magidor iteration.  The purpose of this talk is to present a Mathias-type criterion which characterizes when a sequence of omega-sequences is generic for the Magidor iteration. The result extends a theorem of Fuchs, who introduced a Mathias criterion for discrete products of Prikry forcings. We will present the new criterion, discuss several applications, and outline the main ideas of the proof. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

						<div style="display:none" id="10">
							 <p> Maximal almost disjoint (MAD) families and their relatives have been an important area of combinatorial and descriptive set theory since at least the 60s. In this talk I will discuss some relatives of MAD families, focussing on eventually different families of functions $f:&#92;omega &#92;to &#92;omega$ and eventually different sets of permutations $p &#92;in S(&#92;omega)$. In the context of MAD families it has been fruitful to consider various strengthenings of the maximality condition to obtain several flavors of 'strongly' MAD families. One such strengthening that has proved useful in recent literature is that of <em>tightness</em>. Tight MAD families are Cohen indestructible and come with a properness preservation theorem making them nice to work with in iterated forcing contexts. </p>

<p> I will introduce a version of tightness for maximal eventually different families of functions $f:&#92;omega &#92;to &#92;omega$ and maximal eventually different families of permutations $p &#92;in S(&#92;omega)$ respectively. These tight eventually different families share a lot of the nice, forcing theoretic properties of tight MAD families. Using them, I will construct explicit witnesses to $&#92;mathfrak{a}_e= &#92;mathfrak{a}_p = &#92;aleph_1$ in many known models of set theory where this equality was either not known or only known by less constructive means. Working over $L$ we can moreover have the witnesses be $&#92;Pi^1_1$ which is optimal for objects of size $&#92;aleph_1$ in models where ${&#92;rm CH}$ fails. These results simultaneously strengthen several known results on the existence of definable maximal sets of reals which are indestructible for various definable forcing notions. This is joint work with Vera Fischer.</p>

						<div style="display:none" id="12">
							 <p>We define a set of real numbers to be perfectly small if it has perfectly many disjoint translates. Such sets have a strong intuitive claim to being probabilistically negligible, yet no non-trivial measure assigns them all a value of 0. We will prove from a moderate amount of choice that any total extension of Lebesgue measure concentrates on a perfectly small set, suggesting that for any such measure, translation-invariance fails 'as badly as possible.' From the ideas of this proof, we will also derive analogues of well-known paradoxes of randomness, specifically Freiling's symmetry paradox and the infinite prisoner hat puzzle, in terms of perfectly small sets. Finally, we discuss how these results constrain what a paradox-free set theory can look like and some related open questions.</p> <p><strong><a href='/files/ParadoxUpdate.pdf'>A note on paradoxes</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTMyB-bCWcQ'>Video</a></strong></p>

						<div style="display:none" id="15">
							 <p> The large cardinal strength of the Axiom of Determinacy when enhanced with the hypothesis that all sets of reals are universally Baire is known to be much stronger than the Axiom of Determinacy itself. In fact, Sargsyan conjectured it to be as strong as the existence of a cardinal that is both a limit of Woodin cardinals and a limit of strong cardinals. Larson, Sargsyan and Wilson showed that this would be optimal via a generalization of Woodin’s derived model construction. We will discuss a new translation procedure for hybrid mice extending work of Steel, Zhu and Sargsyan and use this to prove Sargsyan’s conjecture. </p>

							 <p>The approximation property was introduced by Hamkins for his Gap Forcing Theorem, and it has turned out to be a very useful notion, appearing for example in the partial equiconsistency result of Viale and Weiss on PFA, and in the proof of Woodin's HOD Dichotomy Theorem.  In the context of generic embeddings, there can be a useful interplay between elementarity and approximation.  We discuss some recent work in this direction: (1) tensions between saturated ideals on $&#92;omega_2$ and the tree property (with Sean Cox), (2) fragility of the strong independence spectra (with Vera Fischer), and (3) mutual inconsistency of Foreman‘s minimal generic hugeness axioms. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ia8MciO_7ww'>Video</a></strong></p>

						<div style="display:none" id="17">
							 <p>The distinction between 'algebraic' and 'non-algebraic fields in mathematics, coined by Shapiro (1997), plays an important role in discussions about the status of set theory and connects back to the so-called universe/multiverse debate in the philosophy of set theory. In this talk we will see, that this distinction is not as clear cut as is usually assume when using it in the debate. In particular, we will see that in more recent formulations of this distinction, multiversism seems to split into a a strong and a weaker form. This can be translated to a meta-level, when considering  the background theory in which set-theoretic multiversism can take place. This offers a more fine-grained picture of multiversism and allows us to mitigate a standard universist objection based on the conception of a multiversist background theory. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

<p>Broad Infinity is a new and arguably intuitive axiom scheme in set theory.  It states that 'broad numbers', which are three-dimensional trees whose growth is controlled, form a set. If the Axiom of Choice is assumed, then Broad Infinity is equivalent to the Ord-is-Mahlo scheme: every closed unbounded class of ordinals contains a regular ordinal.</p> <p> Whereas the axiom of Infinity leads to generation principles for sets and families and ordinals, Broad Infinity leads to more advanced versions of these principles.  The talk explains these principles and how they are related under various prior assumptions: the Axiom of Choice, the Law of Excluded Middle, and weaker assumptions. </p> <p><strong><a href='/files/LevySlides032021.pdf'>Slides</a></strong></p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHuHHnR1Hec'>Video</a></strong></p>

						<div style="display:none" id="24">
							 <p>Tarski proved (but didn't publish) the theorem that choice from pairs implies choice from four-element sets. Mostowski (1937) began a systematic study of such implications between choice axioms for families of finite sets. Gauntt (1970) completed that study (but didn't publish the results), obtaining equivalent characterizations in terms of fixed points of permutation groups. Truss (1973) extended Gauntt's results (and published this work).</p>
<p>It turns out that these finite choice axioms and their group-theoretic characterizations are instances of the same topos-theoretic statements, interpreted in two very different classes of topoi. My main result is an extension of that observation to the class of all topoi.</p>
<p>Most of my talk will be explaining the background: finite choice axioms, permutation groups, and a little bit about topoi - just enough to make sense of the main result. If time permits, I'll describe some of the ingredients of the proof.</p>

							 <p> Vopenka's Principle (VP) says that for every proper class of structures with the same signature, there is an elementary embedding from one structure in the class to another.  An equivalent form of VP says that for every proper class of graphs, there is an embedding from one graph in the class to another; let us denote this form by VP(graphs, embeddings) with the obvious meaning.  We can obtain weaker instances of VP by restricting to particular kinds of graphs such as trees, which are connected acyclic graphs, and rayless trees, which are trees with no infinite path.  We will show that VP(trees, embeddings) and VP(rayless trees, embeddings) occupy two different places in the large cardinal hierarchy below VP, and that each is equivalent to the existence of certain virtual large cardinals.  Namely, we will show that VP(trees, embeddings) is equivalent to the existence of a weakly virtually A-extendible cardinal (as defined by Gitman and Hamkins) for every class A, and VP(rayless trees, embeddings) is equivalent to the existence of what we will call a weakly virtually A-strong cardinal for every class A.  For a better-known point of comparison: the former large cardinal hypothesis is stronger than the existence of a remarkable cardinal, whereas the latter is weaker.  We will also relate these two instances of VP to other variants of VP such as generic Vopenka's Principle (as defined by Bagaria, Gitman, and Schindler) and generic Weak Vopenka's Principle. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVuDBZt7fWs'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p>We are going to talk about some inequalities between cardinal characteristics of the continuum. In particular we are going to relate cardinal characteristics pertaining to the convergenve of series, recently isolated by Blass, Brendle, Brian and Hamkins, other characteristcs concerning equitable splitting defined comparatatively recently by Brendle, Halbeisen, Klausner, Lischka and Shelah and some characteristics defined less recently by Miller, Blass, Laflamme and Minami. All proofs in question are elementary. </p> <p><strong><a href='/files/WeinertSlides012021.pdf'>Slides</a></strong></p>
