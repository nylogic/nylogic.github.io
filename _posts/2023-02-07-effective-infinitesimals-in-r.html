<p>
We survey the effective foundations for analysis with
infinitesimals recently developed by Hrbacek and Katz, and detail some
applications.  Theories SPOT and SCOT illustrate the fact that
analysis with infinitesimals requires no more choice than traditional
analysis.  The theory SCOT incorporates in particular all the axioms
of Nelson's Radically Elementary Probability Theory, which is
therefore conservative over ZF+ADC.
