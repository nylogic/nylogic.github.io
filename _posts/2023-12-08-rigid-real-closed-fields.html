<p>
Every archimedean real closed field is rigid, i.e., has no nontrivial automorphisms.  What happens in the non-archimedean case?  Shelah showed it is consistent that there are uncountable rigid non-archimedean real closed fields.  Enayat asked what happens in the countable case. I believe the question is even interesting in the finite transcendence degree case.  In this talk I will describe Shelah's proof and discuss some interesting phenomenon that arises even in transcendence degree 2.
