abstract: "<p>
We'll discuss Shelah's technology of $(&#92;mathcal L, N)$ models and its applications to independence results in PA. This includes an alternative proof of the Paris-Harrington theorem and a sharpening to a $&#92;Pi^0_1$ true but unprovable statement of some mathematical interest. Time permitting, we'll also connect these ideas to Kripke's notion of Fulfillment and Wilkie's theorem on Why PA.
