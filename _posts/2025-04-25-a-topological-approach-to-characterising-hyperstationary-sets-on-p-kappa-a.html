Given a topological space $(X, &#92;tau)$, the derived set operator $d_&#92;tau$ maps a set $T$ to its set of limit points with respect to $&#92;tau$. Fixing an initial topology $&#92;tau_0$ on $X$, we can define a sequence of <em>derived topologies</em> $(X, &#92;tau_0, &#92;tau_1, &#92;dots, &#92;tau_&#92;xi, &#92;dots)$, where $&#92;tau_&#92;zeta &#92;subseteq &#92;tau_&#92;xi$ for $&#92;zeta &#92;lt &#92;xi$. This is achieved by declaring $d_{&#92;tau_&#92;xi}(T)$ to be open in $&#92;tau_{&#92;xi+1}$ and taking unions at limit stages.

In <em>Derived Topologies on Ordinals and Stationary Reflection</em>, Bagaria characterised the non-isolated points in the $&#92;xi$-th derived topology on ordinals as those satisfying a strong iterated form of stationary reflection, termed $&#92;xi$-simultaneous reflection.
</p><p>
Generalisations of combinatorial properties of ordinals to $&#92;mathcal{P}_&#92;kappa(A) := &#92;{X &#92;subseteq &#92;kappa : |X| &#92;lt &#92;kappa&#92;}$, where $&#92;kappa$ is an uncountable regular cardinal and $A &#92;subseteq &#92;kappa$, have been widely studied. In this context, we extend the notion of higher stationarity and construct a sequence of topologies $&#92;langle &#92;tau_0, &#92;tau_1, &#92;dots &#92;rangle$ on $&#92;mathcal{P}_&#92;kappa(A)$, characterising the simultaneous reflection of <em>high-stationary</em> subsets of $&#92;mathcal{P}_&#92;kappa(A)$ in terms of elements in the base of a derived topology on $&#92;mathcal{P}_&#92;kappa(A)$.
