In their 1979 paper `Minimal Infinite Topological Spaces,â€™ Ginsburg and Sands proved that every infinite topological space has an infinite subspace homeomorphic to exactly one of the following five topologies on $&#92;omega$&#58; indiscrete, discrete, initial segment, final segment, and cofinite. The proof, while nonconstructive, features an interesting application of Ramsey's theorem for pairs ($&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$). We analyze this principle in computability theory and reverse mathematics, using Dorais's formalization of CSC spaces. Among our results are that the Ginsburg-Sands theorem for CSC spaces is equivalent to $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0,$ while for Hausdorff spaces it is provable in $&#92;mathsf{RCA}_0$. Furthermore, if we enrich a CSC space by adding the closure operator on points, then the Ginsburg-Sands theorem turns out to be equivalent to the Chain-Antichain Principle ($&#92;mathsf{CAC}$). The most surprising case is that of the Ginsburg-Sands theorem restricted to $T_1$ spaces. Here, we show that the principle lies strictly between $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$, yielding perhaps the first natural theorem of ordinary mathematics (i.e., conceived outside of logic) to occupy this interval. I will discuss the proofs of both the implications and separations, which feature several novel combinatorial elements, and survey a new class of purely combinatorial principles below $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and not implied by $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$ revealed by our investigation. This is joint work with Heidi Benham, Andrew DeLapo, Reed Solomon, and Java Darleen Villano.
