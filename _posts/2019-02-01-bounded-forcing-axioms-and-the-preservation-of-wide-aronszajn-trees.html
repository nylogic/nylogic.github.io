abstract: "<p>
I will talk about connections between three properties of a forcing class $&#92;Gamma$&#58; the most well-known one is the bounded forcing axiom at $(&#92;omega_1,&#92;lambda)$ for this class, introduced by Goldstern and Shelah for proper forcing. The second property is a two cardinal version of $&#92;Sigma^1_1$ absoluteness, at $(&#92;omega_1,&#92;lambda)$, and the third is the preservation of Aronszajn trees of height $&#92;omega_1$ and width $&#92;lambda$. Under the assumption that $&#92;lambda=&#92;lambda^&#92;omega$ and forcings in $&#92;Gamma$ don't add countable subsets of $&#92;lambda$, I will show that these properties are equivalent. The class of forcing notions satisfying Jensen's property of subcompleteness is a canonical class that does not add reals and it is a corollary of the above result that the bounded forcing axiom for subcomplete forcing at $(&#92;omega_1,2^&#92;omega)$ is equivalent to the preservation of Aronszajn trees of height $&#92;omega_1$ and width $2^&#92;omega$. This generalizes a prior result, obtained jointly with Kaethe Minden. I will discuss some further results, as well as some open questions, on the preservation of Aronszajn trees of height $&#92;omega_1$ and other widths.
