abstract: "Zermelo famously characterized the models of second-order Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory $&#92;text{ZFC}_2$ in his 1930 quasi-categoricity result asserting that the models of $&#92;text{ZFC}_2$ are precisely those isomorphic to a rank-initial segment $V_&#92;kappa$ of the cumulative set-theoretic universe $V$ cut off at an inaccessible cardinal $&#92;kappa.$ I shall discuss the extent to which Zermelo's quasi-categoricity analysis can rise fully to the level of categoricity, in light of the observation that many of the $V_&#92;kappa$ universes are categorically characterized by their sentences or theories. For example, if $&#92;kappa$ is the smallest inaccessible cardinal, then up to isomorphism $V_&#92;kappa$ is the unique model of $&#92;text{ZFC}_2$ plus the sentence 'there are no inaccessible cardinals.' This cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is therefore an instance of what we call a first-order <em>sententially categorical</em> cardinal. Similarly, many of the other inaccessible universes satisfy categorical extensions of $&#92;text{ZFC}_2$ by a sentence or theory, either in first or second order. I shall thus introduce and investigate the categorical cardinals, a new kind of large cardinal. This is joint work with Robin Solberg (Oxford).
