<p>
 Model-theoretic frameworks for nonstandard methods require the existence of nonprincipal ultrafilters over N, a strong form of the Axiom of Choice (AC).  While  AC is instrumental in many abstract areas of mathematics, its use in infinitesimal calculus or number theory should not be necessary.

<p>
In the paper KH and  M. G. Katz, Infinitesimal analysis without the Axiom of Choice, Ann. Pure Applied Logic 172, 6  (2021), <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04980'>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04980</a>, we have formulated SPOT, a theory in the language that has, in addition to membership, a unary predicate 'is standard.'  The theory extends ZF by three simple axioms, Transfer, Nontriviality and Standard Part, that reflect the insights of Leibniz.  It is a subtheory of the nonstandard set theories IST and HST, but unlike them, it is a conservative extension of ZF. Arguments carried out in SPOT thus do not depend on any form of AC.  Infinitesimal calculus can be developed in SPOT.  A stronger theory SCOT is a conservative extension of ZF + Dependent Choice. It is suitable for handling such features as an infinitesimal approach to the Lebesgue measure.

Renling Jin recently gave a groundbreaking nonstandard proof of Szemeredi's theorem in a model-theoretic framework that has three levels of infinity.  I will formulate and motivate SPOTS, a multi-level version of  SPOT, carry out Jin's proof of Ramsey's theorem in SPOTS, and discuss how his proof of Szemeredi's theorem can be developed in it.
</p>
<p>
While it is still open whether SPOTS is conservative over ZF, SCOTS (the multi-level version of SCOT) is a conservative extension of ZF + Dependent Choice.
