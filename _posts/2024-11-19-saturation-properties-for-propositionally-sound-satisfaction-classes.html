<p>
Over the last years, a lot of progress has been achieved in understanding the arithmetical strength of axiomatic theories of compositional truth. It turned out that a theory $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$ of compositional truth for arithmetical sentences can become non-conservative over $&#92;mathsf{PA}$ upon adding some seemingly benign principles.</p>
<p>
One of the principles whose arithmetical strength is still unknown is the axiom of propositional soundness which says that for any arithmetical sentence $&#92;phi$ which is a propositional tautology, $&#92;phi$ is true in the sense of the truth predicate. It is an open problem whether this axiom together with $CT^-$ is conservative over $PA$.</p>
<p>
In our talk, we will show that if $(M,T)$ is a model of $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$ satisfying the propositional soundness principle, then $(M,T)$ satisfies a certain amount of saturation&#58; if $(&#92;phi_i)_{i &#92;lt c}$ is a sequence of sentences such that for any standard $i$, $&#92;phi_i$ is true in the sense of the truth predicate, then there is a nonstandard $d$ such that for each  $i &#92;in [0,d]$, $&#92;phi_i$ is true. This puts very strong limitations on any possible conservativeness proof. The result may be seen as a counterpart to the classical theorem of Lachlan which says that the arithmetical part of any model of $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$ is recursively saturated.
