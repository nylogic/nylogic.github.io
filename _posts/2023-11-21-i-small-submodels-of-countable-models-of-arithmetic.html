There has been a long tradition in the model theory of arithmetic of attributing the combinatorial properties of <em>cardinal numbers</em> in set theory to <em>initial</em> segments. Considering that the most basic use of cardinal numbers is to assign <em>cardinality</em> to sets, we can adapt a similar notion in models of arithmetic in the following way&#58; for a given initial segment $I$ of any model $&#92;mathcal M$ of a fragment of arithmetic, say I$&#92;Sigma_1$, a subset $X $ of $&#92;mathcal M$ is called <em>I-small</em> if there exists a coded bijection $f$ in $&#92;mathcal M$ such that the range of the restriction of $f$ to $I$ is equal to $X$. It turns out that for a given countable nonstandard model $&#92;mathcal M$ of I$&#92;Sigma_1$, when I is a strong cut, any $I$-small $&#92;Sigma_1$-elementary submodel of $&#92;mathcal M$ contains $I$, and inherits some good properties of $I$. In this talk, we are going to review such properties through self-embeddings of $&#92;mathcal M$.
