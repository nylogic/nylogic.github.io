							 <p> Since Hironaka proved resolution of singularities over base fields of characteristic zero in 1964, the corresponding problem in positive characteristic has remained open, and so has its local form, called local uniformization. The latter is in fact a valuation theoretical problem, due to ideas of Zariski. I will present these ideas and show the connection of local uniformization with the structure theory of valued function fields. The positive characteristic case is so much harder than the characteristic zero case because of the phenomenon of the defect. I will define it and sketch strategies to either avoid it or work around it; these led to some partial solutions to the local uniformization problem. </p><p> In 1965, one year after Hironaka, Ax and Kochen used the model theory of valued fields to prove a corrected version of Artin's Conjecture. Thereafter they, and independently Ershov, proved the decidability of the elementary theory of the fields of p-adic numbers. The problem for their counterpart in positive characteristic, the Laurent series fields over finite fields, is still open. I will explain which tools can be used to prove decidability. Via general principles of model theory, the task can be reduced to proving embedding lemmas for valued function fields, which I will describe. This in turn requires a good structure theory for such valued function fields, and this is what our decidability problem has in common with the local uniformization problem. In analogy to the local uniformization problem, our theory of the defect has led to partial solutions, in the sense of new model theoretic results about certain classes of valued fields in positive characteristic. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p> ​

							 <p> Classically, an object is ordinal definable if it is the unique one satisfying a formula with ordinal parameters. Generalizing this concept, given a cardinal $&#92;kappa$, I call an object $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable if it belongs to an ordinal definable set with fewer than $&#92;kappa$ elements (called a $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurry definition). By considering the hereditary versions of this notion, one arrives at a hierarchy of inner models, indexed by cardinals $&#92;kappa$: the collection of all hereditarily $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable sets, which I call $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-HOD. In a ZFC-model, this hierarchy spans the entire spectrum from HOD to V. </p> <p> The special cases $&#92;kappa=&#92;omega$ and $&#92;kappa=&#92;omega_1$ have been previously considered, but no systematic study of the general setting has been carried out, it seems. One main aspect of the analysis is the notion of a leap, that is, a cardinal at which a new object becomes hereditarily blurrily definable. </p> <p> In this talk, I will focus on the ZFC-provable structural properties of the blurry HOD hierarchy, which turn out to be surprisingly plentiful. So for the most part, the talk will be forcing-free. Time permitting, I may hint at the result of the equiconsistency between the least leap being the successor of a singular strong limit cardinal and the existence of a measurable cardinal, for which, admittedly, forcing is used in one direction. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p> ​

							 <p> The Heisenberg group G(F) of a field F is the group of upper triangular matrices in GL_3(F), with 1's along the diagonal and 0's below it.  This group is obviously interpretable (indeed definable) in the field F.  Mal'cev showed that one can recover F from G(F), and indeed that there is an interpretation of F in G(F) using two parameters.  Any two noncommuting elements of G(F) can serve as the parameters, but Mal'cev was unable to produce an interpretation without parameters. </p><p> After introducing the notions of a <em>computable functor</em> and an <em>effective interpretation</em>, we will present joint work showing that there is an effective interpretation of each countable field in its Heisenberg group, without parameters, uniformly in F.  (That is, the same formulas give the interpretation, no matter which field F we consider.)  Moreover, from the effective interpretation we will then extract a traditional interpretation without parameters, in the usual model-theoretic sense.  Finally we will note that, whereas Mal'cev's result actually gives a definition of F in G(F), there is no parameter-free definition of F there. </p><p> This work is joint with Rachael Alvir, Wesley Calvert, Grant Goodman, Valentina Harizanov, Julia Knight, Andrey Morozov, Alexandra Soskova, and Rose Weisshaar.</p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybhDXlWsaQQ'>Video</a></strong></p> ​

							 <p>Jensen constructed in $L$, using $&#92;diamondsuit$, a subposet of the Sacks forcing with the ccc and the property that it adds a unique generic real over $L$ (in contrast to, say, Cohen forcing which adds continuum many generic reals). He used what came to be known as Jensen's forcing to show that, consistently, there can be a $&#92;Pi^1_2$-definable non-constructible real. The 'uniqueness of generic reals' property of Jensen's forcing extends to products of Jensen's forcing and to finite iterations, when forcing over $L$. Indeed, a Jensen-like forcing with the same uniqueness properties can be constructed in any universe with a $&#92;diamondsuit$-sequence. In a joint work with Friedman and Kanovei, we used a tree iteration of Jensen's forcing to construct (in a symmetric submodel of the forcing extension) a model of full second-order arithmetic ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ with the choice scheme in which the dependent choice scheme failed for a $&#92;Pi^1_2$-assertion (this is optimal because ${&#92;rm Z}_2$ with the choice scheme implies dependent choice for $&#92;Sigma^1_2$-assertions). In this talk, I will present a generalization of Jensen's forcing to forcing with perfect $&#92;kappa$-trees for an inaccessible cardinal $&#92;kappa$. I will show that Jensen's forcing at an inaccessible has the same 'uniqueness of generics' properties as Jensen's forcing. One of the goals of this work is to prove an analogue of the second-order arithmetic result for second-order set theory by showing that the dependent choice scheme is independent of the second-order Kelley-Morse set theory with the choice scheme. This is joint work with Sy-David Friedman.</p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUZ7vcGL05I'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> One could make the claim that category theory is as  foundational as set-theory or model-theory. So, we should be able to transfer from one perspective to the other. In this talk, I will consider one aspect of this meta-equivalence, by introducing a theory  in a very simple, one-sorted(!) language, whose models are  all  categories admitting a terminal object (many categories do). Many categorical constructions  then turn out to be first-order. But something even more strange  happens: standard categories (like the category of Abelian groups) become actually universal models! I'll explain this apparent contradiction. </p> <p> In the second part of the talk, I will concentrate on one particularly interesting category: that of compact Hausdorff spaces. I will show that we can recover the natural numbers $N$ and the reals $R$, or rather, (the isomorphism classes of) their compactifications $&#92;bar N$ and $&#92;bar R$,  by parameter-free definitions, including their order relation,   addition and   multiplication. Moreover, in any category  that is elementary equivalent to the category of compact Hausdorff spaces, the resulting objects are then a model of PA and a real closed field respectively. Full disclosure: while I have a complete proof for the first assertion, the second is still conjectural.</p> <p> Apart from some basic model-theory, category theory and topology, everything else will be explained in the talk and so it should be accessible to many. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV391eEP0u4'>Video</a></strong></p> ​

							 <p> It is well known that every countable recursively saturated model of $&#92;mathsf{PA}$ has a full compositional truth predicate; that is, such a model is expandable to the theory $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$. It is also well known that such a truth predicate need not be inductive, or indeed, need not satisfy even $&#92;Delta_0$ induction. Recently, Enayat and Pakhomov showed that $&#92;Delta_0$ induction for the truth predicate is equivalent to the principle of disjunctive correctness: the assertion that for any sequence of sentences $&#92;langle &#92;phi_i : i &#92;lt c &#92;rangle$, the disjunction $&#92;bigvee&#92;limits_{i &#92;lt c} &#92;phi_i$ is evaluated as true if and only if there is $i &#92;lt c$ such that $&#92;phi_i$ is evaluated as true. In the absence of $&#92;Delta_0$ induction, various pathologies can occur, including models of $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$ for which all nonstandard length disjunctions are evaluated as true. In this talk, we classify the sets X for which there is a model of $&#92;mathsf{CT}^-$ in which X is exactly the set of those c such that the disjunctions of length c of 0 = 1 is evaluated as false. In particular, we see that X can be $&#92;omega$ if and only if $&#92;omega$ is a strong cut, and therefore the 'disjunctively trivial' models mentioned before are in fact arithmetically saturated. This is joint work (in progress) with Mateusz Łełyk, drawing heavily on unpublished work by Jim Schmerl. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKDFXLa8RXA'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> I will discuss a theory developed in my joint paper with Junguk Lee and Slavko Moconja. One can view it as a variant of Kechris, Pestov, and Todorčević theory in the context of (complete first order) theories. I will discuss several 'definable' Ramsey-theoretic properties of first order theories and their dynamical characterizations. The point is that all the Ramsey-theoretic properties that we introduce involve 'definable colorings' and the dynamical characterizations are 'dynamical properties of the theories', i.e. they are expressed in terms of the action of the group of automorphisms of a monster (i.e. sufficiently saturated and homogeneous) model of the theory in question on the appropriate space of types.  One of the basic results says that a theory has the definable Ramsey property iff it is extremely amenable (as defined by Hrushovski, Pillay and myself). But there are various other results, some of which are essentially new and may be surprising in comparison with the Kechris, Pestov, Todorčević theory. One of the motivations to study those properties was to understand better the so-called Ellis group of a theory (which was used by Pillay, Rzepecki, and myself to explain the nature of the Lascar Galois groups of first order theories and spaces of strong types, and led E. Hrushovski to some original development with striking applications to approximate subgroups). Using our dynamical characterizations, we obtain several criteria for profiniteness and for triviality of this Ellis group, with many examples where they apply. I will try to discuss it during my talk. If time permits, I may very briefly mention an abstract generalization of the above considerations and results,  which also applies both to the context of definable groups as well as to the classical  context of Kechris Pestov, Todorčević theory, leading to some new notions, results, and questions.

							 <p>Various results establish deep connections between the existence of large cardinals, regularity properties of strong logics and the validity of set-theoretic reflection principles. In particular, several compactness properties of strong logics were proven to be equivalent to  large cardinal axioms. An important example of such an equivalence is given by a theorem of Makowsky that shows that <em>Vopěnka's Principle</em> is equivalent to the existence of strong compactness cardinals for all abstract logics. Motivated by  work of Boney, Dimopoulos, Gitman and Magidor, I recently proved an analogous combinatorial characterization of the existence of weak compactness cardinals for all abstract logics that is closely connected to the notion of <em>subtle cardinals</em>, introduced by Kunen and Jensen in their studies of strong diamond principles, and the concept of <em>shrewd cardinals</em>, defined by Rathjen in proof-theoretic work. In my talk, I want to first discuss the details of this characterization and then present connections to recent joint work with Joan Bagaria (Barcelona) on recurring patterns in the large cardinal hierarchy.</p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-KA3jgJpNM'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> Say that a theory $T$ is tight if any two distinct extensions of $T$ cannot be bi-interpretable. Vaguely speaking, tightness expresses a sort of maximality to the expressiveness of $T$. Visser showed that $&#92;mathsf{PA}$ is tight and building on this work, Enayat showed that $&#92;mathsf{Z}_2$, second-order arithmetic with full second-order comprehension, is also tight. In this talk I will address the question of whether full logical strength of these theories of arithmetic are necessary to have tightness, focusing on subsystems of $&#92;mathsf{Z}_2$. The answer to this question is positive. If you restrict the comprehension axiom of $&#92;mathsf{Z}_2$ to only arithmetical formulae, or if you restrict it to $&#92;Sigma^1_k$ formulae, the resulting theory is not tight. As a specific instance, we show that if $M$ is either the minimum omega-model of $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ or the minimum beta-model of $&#92;Pi^1_k$-$&#92;mathsf{CA}$ for some $k &#92;ge 1$, then $M$ is bi-interpretable with a carefully chosen extension $M[c] $ by Cohen-forcing.</p> <p> This talk is about joint work with Alfredo Roque Freire.

							 <p> Over half a century ago Hyman Bass proved that all flat left modules are projective precisely when the underlying ring satisfies the descending chain condition on right principal ideals. He called such rings left perfect. Gena Puninski noticed that this can be given a model theoretic proof. Every infinite descending chain of principal right ideals gives rise to a descending chain of (pp) formulas which, in turn, gives rise to a direct limit of finitely generated projective modules that is not projective.

The least size of a maximal (with respect to inclusion) ideal independent family is denoted $&#92;mathfrak{s}_{mm}$ and has recently been tied to several interesting questions in cardinal characteristics and Boolean algebra theory. In this talk we will sketch our new proof that this number is ZFC-provably greater than or equal to the ultrafilter number – the least size of a base for a non-principal ultrafilter on $&#92;omega$. The proof is entirely combinatorial and relies only on a knowledge of ultrafilters and their properties. Time permitting, we will also discuss some interesting new applications of ideal independent families to topology via a generalization of Mrowka spaces usually studied for almost disjoint families.

My aforementioned paper demonstrates that besides PA, certain other canonical theories such as Z_2 (Second Order Arithmetic), ZF, and KM (Kelley-Morse Class Theory) are also solid. The first talk in this series will present &#58; (a) the proofs of solidity of PA and Z_2, and (b) the relationship between Väänänen's notion of internal categoricity with the notions of solidity and tightness. The second part will concentrate on establishing the failure of solidity/tightness of certain subtheories of PA and Z_2, including any subtheory of PA or Z_2 that is finitely axiomatizable.</p>

							 <p>A tree of height $&#92;omega_1$ with no cofinal branch is called <em> special</em> if it can be decomposed into countably many antichains or, equivalently if it carries a specializing function: a function $f:T &#92;to &#92;omega$ so that if $f(s) = f(t)$ then $s$ and $t$ are incomparable in the tree ordering. It is known that there is always a non-special tree of size continuum, but the existence of a smaller one is independent of ZFC. Motivated by this we introduce the special tree number, $&#92;mathfrak{st}$, the least size of a tree of height $&#92;omega_1$ which is neither non-special nor has a cofinal branch. Classical facts imply that $&#92;mathfrak{st}$ can be smaller than essentially all well studied cardinal characteristics. Conversely in this talk we will show that $&#92;mathfrak{st}$ can be larger than $&#92;mathfrak{a}$, $&#92;mathfrak{g}$, and both the left hand side and bottom row of the Cichon diagram. Thus $&#92;mathfrak{st}$ is independent of many well known cardinal invariants. Central to this result is an in depth investigation of the types of reals added by the Baumgartner specialization poset which we will discuss as well. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> We consider the following two player game of infinite length: We are given a starting set X, and the players go by the names 'Cut' and 'Choose'. They take turns making moves, and in each step, Cut partitions a given set into two disjoint pieces, starting from the set X in their first move, and then Choose gets to pick one of the pieces, which is then partitioned into two pieces by Cut in their next move etc. In the end, Choose wins in case the intersection of all of their choices has at least two (distinct) elements.</p> <p> We will investigate some of the properties of this game — in particular, we will discuss some classic results on when it is possible for one of the players to have a strategy for winning the game. We will then continue to discuss some variations of this game and their relevance to set theory — many central set theoretic notions, such as certain large cardinal properties, notions of distributivity, precipitousness and strategic closure were either known or turned out to be closely connected and often equivalent to the (non-)existence of winning strategies in certain cut and choose games.</p> <p> This is joint work with Philipp Schlicht, Christopher Turner and Philip Welch (all University of Bristol). </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> It is well known that if an inaccessible cardinal $&#92;kappa$ is singularized to countable cofinality while preserving cardinals, then $&#92;square_{&#92;kappa_&#92;omega}$ holds in the outer model. Moreover, this remains true even when relaxing the cardinal preservation assumption a bit. In this talk we focus on when Prikry forcing adds weaker forms of square in a more general setting. We prove abstract theorems about when Prikry forcing with interleaved collapses to bring down the singularized cardinal to $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$ will add a weak square sequence. This can be viewed as a partial positive result to a question of Woodin about whether the failure of SCH at $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$ implies weak square. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p> ​

							 <p> Given a set $S$, an $S$-predictor $&#92;mathcal{P}$ is a function that takes as inputs functions of the form $f:(-&#92;infty,t)&#92;rightarrow S$, where $t&#92;in&#92;mathbb{R}$, and outputs a guess $&#92;mathcal{P}(f)$ for what $f(t)$ 'should be.' An $S$-predictor is good if for all total functions $F:&#92;mathbb{R}&#92;to S$ the set of $t&#92;in&#92;mathbb{R}$ for which the guess $&#92;mathcal{P}(F&#92;upharpoonright(-&#92;infty,t))$ is not equal to $F(t)$ has measure zero. Hardin and Taylor proved that every set $S$ has a good $S$-predictor and they raised various questions asking about the extent to which the prediction $&#92;mathcal{P}(f)$ made by a good predictor might be invariant after precomposing $f$ with various well-behaved functions - this leads to the notion of 'anonymity' of good predictors under various classes of functions. Bajpai and Velleman answered several of Hardin and Taylor's questions and asked: Does there exist, for every set $S$, a good $S$-predictor that is anonymous with respect to the strictly increasing analytic homeomorphisms of $&#92;mathbb{R}$? We provide a consistently negative answer to this question by strengthening a result of Erdős, which states that the Continuum Hypothesis is equivalent to the existence of an uncountable family $F$ of (real or complex) analytic functions, such that $&#92;{f(x):f&#92;in F&#92;}$ is countable for every $x$. We strengthen Erdős' result by proving that CH is equivalent to the existence of what we call <em>sparse analytic systems</em> of functions.

							 <p> I shall introduce a flexible new method showing that every countable model of PA admits a pointwise definable end-extension, one in which every individual is definable without parameters. And similarly for models of set theory, in which one may also achieve the Barwise extension result—every countable model of ZF admits a pointwise definable end-extension to a model of ZFC+V=L, or indeed any theory arising in a suitable inner model. A generalization of the method shows that every model of arithmetic of size at most continuum admits a Leibnizian extension, and similarly in set theory.</p>

							 <p>In recent years we have been witnessing a dynamic and fertile connection between logic and operator algebras. Many methods from set theory and model theory have been successfully applied to the investigations of $C^&#92;ast$-algebras and other topics in abstract functional analysis (with a brilliant textbook on the 'Combinatorial Set Theory of $C^&#92;ast$-algebras' by I. Farah presenting the current state of the art in this developing field). The purpose of this talk is to provide an introduction to this fruitful interplay with a focus on a certain set-theoretic problem concerning cardinal characteristics of the Calkin algebra which is a structure that may be thought of as a quantum counterpart of the Boolean algebra of subsets of natural numbers modulo finite sets. </p> <p> Namely, I will present a result concerning possible sizes of families of projections (on a certain Hilbert space) that are mutually pairwise almost orthogonal, which informally means that they are orthogonal modulo 'compact perturbation'.
