abstract: "<p>The goal of Gödel’s argument that the theory (T) of Peano Arithmetic is not complete, was to
show that the Gödel sentences, $G$ , and it’s negation, are not provable in T, unless T is inconsistent.
In this paper we examine the first half of this argument, namely, that from a hypothetical
derivation, $P_{G}$, of $G$, a derivation, $P_{f}$, can be constructed that ends in a contradiction. We make the
observation that the Gödel argument depends on the metatheory concept of representability
that, in turn, depends on the metatheory concept of soundness. Our analysis leads to two main
observations, the first well know, and the second, a challenge to the standard undecidability
argument.</p>

<p>1 – The existence of $P_G$ implies that T is unsound. This conclusion does not require the further
construction, from $P_G$, of the derivation $P_f$.</p>

<p>2 - We argue that effectuation of the construction of $P_f$ is <em>obstructed</em>, because that effectuation
requires acceptance of a contradiction in the metatheory regarding the soundness of T.</p>

<p>This is joint work with Catherine Hennix.</p>"
