							 <p> For a cardinal $&#92;kappa&#92;ge 2$, one can weaken the concept 'x is ordinal definable' (i.e., x is the unique object satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters) to 'x is $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable,' meaning that x is one of fewer than $&#92;kappa$ many objects satisfying some condition involving ordinal parameters. By considering the hereditary version of this, one naturally arrives at the inner model $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-HOD, the class of all hereditarily $&#92;lt&#92;kappa$-blurrily ordinal definable sets. In ZFC, by varying $&#92;kappa$, one obtains a hierarchy of inner models spanning all the way from HOD to V. The leaps are those stages in the hierarchy where something new is added. I have previously given a logic workshop talk about the basic theory of the blurry HOD hierarchy, and in this talk, after reviewing the basics, I want to focus on the consistency strengths of certain leap constellations, ranging from outright consistent, to equiconsistent with a measurable cardinal, to inconsistent. </p>

							 <p> Mutual stationarity is a compactness type property for singular cardinals. Roughly, it asserts that given a singular cardinal $&#92;kappa$, stationary subsets of regular cardinals with limit $&#92;kappa$ have a 'simultaneous witness' for their stationarity. This principle was first defined by Foreman and Magidor in 2001, who showed that it holds when the stationary sets are of points of countable cofinality. They also showed that in general this does not generalize to higher cofinality. Whether the principle can consistently hold for higher cofinalities remained open, until a few years ago Ben Neria showed that from large cardinals mutual stationarity at $&#92;langle&#92;aleph_n&#92;mid n&#92;lt&#92;omega&#92;rangle$ can be forced for any fixed cofinality. </p><p> We show that we can obtain mutual stationarity at $&#92;langle&#92;aleph_n&#92;mid n&#92;lt&#92;omega&#92;rangle$ for any fixed cofinality together with the failure of SCH at $&#92;aleph_&#92;omega$. Along the way we reduce the Ben Neria's large cardinal hypothesis. This is joint work with Will Adkisson. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ix83QG4rmIw'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> The algebraic field extensions of the rational numbers $&#92;mathbb{Q}$ – equivalently, the subfields of the algebraic closure $&#92;overline{&#92;mathbb{Q}}$ – naturally form a topological space homeomorphic to Cantor space.  Consequently, one can speak of 'large' collections of such fields, in the sense of Baire category&#58; collections that are comeager in the space.  Under a standard definition, the <em>1-generic fields</em> form a comeager set in this space.  Therefore, one may think of a property common to all 1-generic fields as a property that one might reasonably expect to be true of an arbitrarily chosen algebraic field. </p><p> We will present joint work with Eisenträger, Springer, and Westrick that proves several intriguing properties to be true of all 1-generic fields $F$.  First, in every such $F$, both the subring $&#92;mathbb{Z}$ of the integers and the subring $&#92;mathcal{O}_F$ of the algebraic integers of $F$ cannot be defined within $F$ by an existential formula, nor by a universal formula.  (Subsequent work by Dittman and Fehm has shown that in fact these subrings are completely undefinable in these fields.)  Next, for every presentation of every such $F$, the <em>root set</em></p> <p align='center'> $ R_F = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X]:p(X)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F&#92;} $ </p><p> is always of low Turing degree relative to that presentation, but is essentially always undecidable relative to the presentation.  Moreover, the set known as <em>Hilbert's Tenth Problem for $F$</em>,</p> <p align='center'> $ HTP(F) = &#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(X_1,&#92;ldots,X_n)=0&#92;text{ has a solution in }F^n&#92;}, $</p> <p> is exactly as difficult as $R_F$, which is its restriction to single-variable polynomials.  Finally, even the question of having infinitely many solutions,</p><p> $&#92;{ p&#92;in &#92;mathbb{Z}[X_1,X_2,&#92;ldots]:p(&#92;vec{X})=0&#92;text{ has infinitely many solutions in }F^n&#92;}, $</p> <p> is only as difficult as $R_F$.  These results are proven by using a forcing notion on the fields and showing that it is decidable whether or not a given condition forces a given polynomial to have a root, or to have infinitely many roots.</p>

							 <p> The Borel hierarchy gives a robust way to stratify the complexity of sets of countable structures and is intimately tied with definability in infinitary logic via the Lopez-Escobar theorem. However, what happens with sets axiomatizable in finitary first-order logic, such as the set of structures satisfying a given finitary first-order theory T? Is the complexity of the set of T's models in any way related to the quantifier complexity of the sentences axiomatizing it? In particular, if a theory T is not axiomatizable by a set of sentences of bounded quantifier complexity, can the set of models of T still be at a finite level of the Borel hierarchy? </p><p> In this talk, we will present results concerning these questions&#58; </p><p> In joint work with Andrews, Gonzalez, Lempp, and Zhu we show that the set of models of a theory T is $&#92;Pi^0_&#92;omega$-complete if and only if T does not have an axiomatization by sentences of bounded quantifier complexity, answering the last question in the negative. We also characterize the Borel complexity of the set of models of complete theories in terms of their finitary axiomatizations. Our results suggest that infinitary logic does not provide any efficacy when defining first-order properties, a phenomenon already observed by Wadge and Keisler and, recently, rediscovered by Harrison-Trainor and Kretschmer using different techniques. </p><p> Combining our results with recent results by Enayat and Visser, we obtain that a large class of theories studied in the foundations of mathematics, sequential theories, have a maximal complicated set of models. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akL5zUz1Jz4'>Video</a></strong></p> ​

<p> Finite Ramsey Theorem states that fixed $n,m,k &#92;in &#92;mathbb N$, there exists $N &#92;in &#92;mathbb N$ such that for each coloring of $[N]^n$ with $k$ colors, there is a homogeneous subset $H$ of $N$ of cardinality at least $m$. Starting with the celebrated Paris-Harrington theorem, many Ramsey-like results have been studied using different largeness notions rather than the cardinality. I will introduce the largeness notion defined by Ketonen and Solovay based on fundamental sequences of ordinals. Then I will describe an alternative and more flexible largeness notion using blocks and barriers. If time allows, I will talk about how the latter can be used to study a more general Ramsey-like result. </p>

							 <p> In their 1979 paper `Minimal Infinite Topological Spaces,’ Ginsburg and Sands proved that every infinite topological space has an infinite subspace homeomorphic to exactly one of the following five topologies on $&#92;omega$&#58; indiscrete, discrete, initial segment, final segment, and cofinite. The proof, while nonconstructive, features an interesting application of Ramsey's theorem for pairs ($&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$). We analyze this principle in computability theory and reverse mathematics, using Dorais's formalization of CSC spaces. Among our results are that the Ginsburg-Sands theorem for CSC spaces is equivalent to $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0,$ while for Hausdorff spaces it is provable in $&#92;mathsf{RCA}_0$. Furthermore, if we enrich a CSC space by adding the closure operator on points, then the Ginsburg-Sands theorem turns out to be equivalent to the Chain-Antichain Principle ($&#92;mathsf{CAC}$). The most surprising case is that of the Ginsburg-Sands theorem restricted to $T_1$ spaces. Here, we show that the principle lies strictly between $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$, yielding perhaps the first natural theorem of ordinary mathematics (i.e., conceived outside of logic) to occupy this interval. I will discuss the proofs of both the implications and separations, which feature several novel combinatorial elements, and survey a new class of purely combinatorial principles below $&#92;mathsf{ACA}_0$ and not implied by $&#92;mathsf{RT}^2_2$ revealed by our investigation. This is joint work with Heidi Benham, Andrew DeLapo, Reed Solomon, and Java Darleen Villano. </p>

The Tukey order of ultrafilters over $&#92;omega$ was studied intensively by Blass, Dobrinen, Isbell, Raghavan, Shelah, Todorcevic and many others, but still contains many fundamental unresolved problems. After reviewing the topological background for the Tukey order, I will present a recent development in the theory of the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters on measurable cardinals, and explain how different the situation is when compared to ultrafilters on $&#92;omega$. Moreover, we will see an important application to the Galvin property of ultrafilters. In the second part of the talk, we will demonstrate how ideas and intuition from ultrafilters over measurable cardinals lead to new results on the Tukey order restricted to ultrafilters over $&#92;omega$. This is joint with Natasha Dobrinen. </p>

							 <p> It is well-known under ZFC that there is a nonstandard model of PA which has a full standard system, i.e. every subset of this model's standard cut is the intersection of the standard cut with some subset of the model which is definable from parameters. We show that the use of Choice here cannot be avoided. More precisely, we prove that it is consistent relative to ZF that no model of PA has full standard system, and it is provable in ZF (or just a fragment of second-order arithmetic) that no Borel model has full standard system. The proof is measure-theoretic in nature, and as a simpler first argument, we will prove from Projective Determinacy the stronger claim that no projective model has full standard system.</p> <p>Since the power set of the naturals is trivially a Scott set, an immediate corollary of this result is that Scott's problem is independent of ZF.</p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> I will present a transfer principle in structural Ramsey theory from finite structures to ultraproducts. In joint work with Bartosova, Dzamonja and Scow, we show that under certain mild conditions and assuming CH, when a class of finite structures has finite small Ramsey degrees, the ultraproduct has finite big Ramsey degrees for internal colorings. All Ramsey-theoretic definitions will be provided, and if time permits, I will give a sketch of the proof. </p>

							 <p> A structure, R,  expanding $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt)$ is called component closed if whenever $X &#92;subseteq R^n$ is definable so are all of $X$'s connected components.   Two basic examples of component closed structures are $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt, +, &#92;cdot)$ and $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt, &#92;cdot, &#92;mathbb{Z})$.  It turns out that these two structures are exemplary of a general phenomenon for component closed structures from a broad class of expansions of $(&#92;mathbb{R}, &#92;lt)$:  either their definable sets are very 'tame' (as in the case of the real closed field) or they are quite 'wild' (as in the case of the real field expanded by the integers).
