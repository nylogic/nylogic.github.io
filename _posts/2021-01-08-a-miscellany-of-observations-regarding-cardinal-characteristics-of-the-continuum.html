abstract: "
<p>We are going to talk about some inequalities between cardinal characteristics of the continuum. In particular we are going to relate cardinal characteristics pertaining to the convergenve of series, recently isolated by Blass, Brendle, Brian and Hamkins, other characteristcs concerning equitable splitting defined comparatatively recently by Brendle, Halbeisen, Klausner, Lischka and Shelah and some characteristics defined less recently by Miller, Blass, Laflamme and Minami. All proofs in question are elementary. </p>
