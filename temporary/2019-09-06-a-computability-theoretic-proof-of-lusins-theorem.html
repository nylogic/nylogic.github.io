<p>
Lusin's Theorem, from real analysis, states that for every Borel-measurable function $f$ from $&#92;mathbb R$ to $&#92;mathbb R$, and for every $&#92;epsilon > 0$, there exists a continuous function $g$ on $&#92;mathbb R$ such that $&#92;{ x&#92;in&#92;mathbb R~:~f(x) &#92;neq g(x)&#92;}$ has measure $< &#92;epsilon$.  This is proven in most introductory real analysis courses, but here we will give a proof using computability theory and computable analysis.  In addition to the theorem itself, the proof will establish an effective way of producing $g$ from $f$ and $&#92;epsilon$, and will pick out, for each $f$, the specific set of troublemakers $x$ in $&#92;mathbb R$ that create all the discontinuities.
