In the paper 'Blowing up the power of a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality', Gitik introduced the forcing which can violate the SCH at singular cardinals of any cofinalities, assuming that the singular cardinals are also singular in the ground model. The forcing is built up from a Mitchell increasing sequence of strong extenders, and it preserves all cardinals and cofinalities in the generic extension. In this talk, we will discuss a forcing which is built from a Mitchell increasing sequence of supercompact extenders. The forcing also violates the SCH at singular cardinals of any cofinalities which are singular in the ground model. An important feature of this forcing is that it is possible to collapse the successor of a singular cardinal, while preserving cardinals above it.
