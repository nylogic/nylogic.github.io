							 <p> I will talk about weak embeddability and the universality number of the class of Aronszajn trees, with a focus on the role of specializing triples. </p><p> The notion of a specializing triple was introduced by Džamonja and Shelah in their strong negative solution to an old problem on the existence of a universal (with respect to weak embeddability) wide Aronszajn tree under Martin's axiom. Their proof has two stages: first, they reprove a theorem of Todorčević showing that under ${&#92;rm MA}_{&#92;omega_1}$ there is no universal Aronszajn tree, and then they show that every wide Aronszajn tree weakly embeds into an Aronszajn tree. The second stage involves a rather complicated ccc forcing. However, already in the first stage, they introduce a new technique: the notion of a specializing triple, and prove that for each Aronszajn tree $T$, there is a ccc forcing adding another Aronszajn tree $T^*$ together with a specializing function on $T^*&#92;otimes T$ such that $(T^*, T, c)$ is a specializing triple. In particular, this shows that $T^*$ does not weakly embed into $T$. </p><p> I will explain how a slight but careful modification of this definition makes it possible to accommodate wide trees directly, yielding a more streamlined proof of Džamonja and Shelah’s result. More precisely, for every $&#92;kappa$-wide Aronszajn tree $T$, there is a ccc forcing adding an Aronszajn tree $T^*$ and a function $c$ such that $(T^*, T, c)$ is what I call a left specializing triple. From this, one quickly recovers Džamonja-Shelah’s theorem: under Martin’s axiom, every class of trees of height $&#92;omega_1$ and size less than the continuum but with no cofinal branches either is not universal for Aronszajn trees, or has universality number equal to the continuum. </p><p> Finally, I will indicate how the modified definition can also be used to show that this consequence of Martin’s axiom is consistent with the existence of a nonspecial Aronszajn tree. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_iEs73ANOM'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> A central question in the theory of large cardinals was whether the existence of a model of ZFC with exactly two normal measures follows from the consistency of ZFC with a measurable cardinal. This was answered positively by a landmark theorem of Friedman and Magidor, whose proof masterfully combined advanced techniques in the theory of large cardinals, including generalized Sacks forcing, forcing over canonical inner models, coding posets, and nonstationary support iterations.</p> <p> In this talk, we present a new and simpler proof of the Friedman-Magidor theorem. A notable feature of our approach is that it avoids any use of inner model theory, making it applicable in the presence of very large cardinals that are beyond the current reach of the inner model program. If time permits, we will also discuss additional applications of the technique: the construction of ZFC models with several normal measures but a single normal ultrapower; a nontrivial model of the weak Ultrapower Axiom from the optimal large cardinal assumption; and a generalization of the Friedman–Magidor theorem to extenders. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWJvrPmu6LE'>Video</a></strong></p>

							 <p> The Partition Principle (PP) states that if there is a surjection A to B then there is an injection B to A. While this is an immediate consequence of the Axiom of Choice (AC), the question of if PP implies AC is one of the longest-standing open questions in set theory. Partial results regarding this come to us from many sources, including a theorem of Pincus that tells us that if 'for all ordinals A and all sets B, if there is a surjection B to A then there is an injection A to B' implies AC for well-orderable families of sets. We shall dissect this and related results, looking into the history of the structure of the cardinals in choiceless models and following the throughline to modern research on eccentric sets and the structure of cardinals as a partial order. </p> <p><strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLnWfkCmUkM'>Video</a></strong></p>

						<div style="display:none" id="5">
							 <p> In this talk we will discuss some problems regarding adding linear order isomorphisms between dense sets of reals via forcing. A set of reals $A &#92;subseteq &#92;mathbb R$ is called $&#92;aleph_1$-<em>dense</em> just in case it has intersection size $&#92;aleph_1$ with every nonempty open interval. Famously Baumgartner showed in the 70s that consistently all $&#92;aleph_1$-dense sets of reals are order isomorphic, thus establishing the consistency of the natural analogue of Cantor's categoricity theorem for countable dense linear orders at the uncountable. He later showed the same statement follows from PFA. The statement 'all $&#92;aleph_1$-dense sets of reals are isomorphic' is now known as Baumgartner's axiom and denoted BA. </p><p> Baumgartner's argument is famously tricky and has several interesting features. Given $&#92;aleph_1$-dense sets $A$ and $B$ he shows that under the continuum hypothesis there is always a ccc partial order for making them isomorphic - but here the CH is important (though it must fail in the final model). Obviously it is therefore natural to ask whether the CH is necessary and, similarly whether BA follows already from MA and not just PFA. Avraham and Shelah showed the answer is 'no' to both&#58; they produced a model of MA in which there is an $&#92;aleph_1$-dense set of reals $A$ so that no ccc forcing notion can add an isomorphism between $A$ and its reverse ordering. In the first part of this talk we will strengthen this result by showing that MA is in fact consistent with an $&#92;aleph_1$-dense linear order $A$ so that any partial order of size $&#92;aleph_1$ which adds an isomorphism between $A$ and its reverse ordering must collapse $&#92;aleph_1$. Thus it is consistent with MA that no such order can even be proper. This part is joint work with Pedro Marun and Saharon Shelah. </p><p> In another direction there is a natural generalization of BA to non-ordered spaces, most notably higher dimensional Euclidean spaces $&#92;mathbb R^n$ for $n > 1$ as well as compact $n$-dimensional manifolds. Curiously, in these cases Steprans and Watson showed that the corresponding BA statements do indeed follow from MA so the case of dimension one is unique. In particular BA for $&#92;mathbb R^n$ with $n > 1$ does not imply the one dimensional case. They then conjectured that conversely BA implies its higher dimensional analogues. In the second part of the talk we will introduce some intrigue to this conjecture by showing any 'reasonable' way of forcing BA - a very general adjective that includes all known methods - must necessarily force the higher dimensional versions and much more including large fragments of MA.

						<div style="display:none" id="6">
							 <p> Tarski’s nondefinability theorem tells us that we cannot internally define satisfaction in a model via a single first-order formula. But how close can we get to that situation without running into inconsistency? We explore a variety of axioms about satisfaction classes, which, surprisingly, all turn out to be equiconsistent and have only mild consistency strength. For example, from a model of ZFC with an inaccessible cardinal, we can obtain a model of GBC with a definable satisfaction class for an inner model. Indeed, this inner model can even be HOD, or the mantle. Finally, we consider the statement that any set is contained in an inner model with a definable satisfaction class — an axiom we call 'Tarski's Revenge'. </p> <p><strong><a href=''>Video</a></strong></p>

						<div style="display:none" id="7">
							 <p> A set with a binary operation * is called an LD-algebra if it satisfies a*(b*c)=(a*b)*(a*c); that is, if left multiplication by any given element a is a homomorphism of the structure.  The existence of rank-to-rank embeddings - non-trivial elementary embeddings from some V_lambda to itself - lies at the top of the large cardinal hierarchy (at least, the part compatible with Choice).  Given a lambda for which such embeddings exist, there is a natural binary operation of 'application' on these embeddings which clearly gives an LD-algebra; Laver showed that in fact, the algebra generated by a single such embedding under application is actually the free LD-algebra on 1 generator.  Many other rank-to-rank embeddings must also exist whenever at least one does, so a natural question is whether Laver's result can be pushed further: does the existence of a rank-to-rank embedding give rise to a free 2-generated LD-algebra of embeddings?  I will present a recent result joint with Scott Cramer and Sheila Miller Edwards, showing that from a slightly stronger large cardinal assumption (but one still compatible with Choice, namely, I2) we indeed get a free 2-generated LD-algebra of embeddings.
